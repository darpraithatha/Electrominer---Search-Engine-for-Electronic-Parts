It has 152x152 black and red ink pixels and a white-ish background. Using our Arduino library, you can create a 'frame buffer' with what pixels you want to have activated and then write that out to the display. Most simple breakouts leave it at that. But if you do the math, 152 x 152 pixels x 2 colors = 5.7 KBytes. Which won't fit into many microcontroller memories. Heck, even if you do have 32KB of RAM, why waste 6KB?

Built in USB means you plug it in to program it, it just shows up - all you need is a Micro-B USB cable, no additional purchases are needed! We have a modified version of the Arduino IDE so Mac & Windows users can get started fast - or with the new 1.6.4+ Arduino IDE, it takes only a few seconds to add Flora-support. The FLORA has USB HID support, so it can act like a mouse or keyboard to attach directly to computers.FLORA has a small but easy to use onboard reset button to reboot the system. The power supply is designed to be flexible and easy to use. There is an onboard polarized 2 JST battery connector with protection schottky diode for use with external battery packs from 3.5v to 16v DC in. Can be used with LiIon/LiPoly, LiFe, alkaline or rechargeable NiMh/NiCad batteries of any size. The FLORA does not have a LiPo charger included by design, this allows safe use with multiple battery types and reduces risk of fire as it is not recommended to charge these batteries on fabric. We suggest one of our micro-lipo chargers if you want to use LiPo batteries with FLORA.FLORA has onboard power switch connected to 2A power FET for safe and efficient battery on/off control, so you can power quite a bit without burning out your switch. The FLORA has an onboard 3.3v 250mA regulator with a protection diode and USB fuse so that the microcontroller voltage is consistent and can power common 3.3v modules and sensors.We spent a lot of time on the power supply because the FLORA power system is specifically designed to allow easy control and power of a large quantity of addressable NeoPixels. Flora can easily drive 50 pixels directly from the onboard power supply, or up to 500 with the pixels externally powered by a separate 5V supply.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/659-07.jpg,/659.jpg,$14.95

Many Pi Plates (PCBs that plug into GPIO port directly) will also work.However 26-pin GPIO cables do not fit this means that you cannot use classic Cobblers, GPIO-cabled boards like the GertBoard/PermaProtoPi without a GPIO downgrading cable.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1138,Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - White 60 LED - WHITE,"These LED strips are even more fun and glowy. There are 60 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for you.The strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 0.65""/1.7cm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need! We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meter (depending on use) and a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 4 meters (depending on use) You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThey come in 4 meter reels with a 2 or 3-pin JST SM connector on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips are sold by the meter! If you buy 4 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 4m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.Â If the piece comes from the end of the reel, the connector may be on the output end of the strip!To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/896,Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Green LEDs + Coin Cell Holder,"Add sparkle to your project with these lovely silver wire LED strands. These strands are very interesting, they use two silver wires that are coated so they don't short if they touch, then tiny 1000mcd LEDs are bonded onto the wires and coated with epoxy. The result is a very flexible silver wire with sparkly ""fairy"" lights that are much less visible than normal LEDs. They're still just LEDs, but in a fun new form-factor! They're even waterproof - you can dunk these or have them outdoors, just be sure to protect the battery holder.Each strand comes with 12 LEDs, approximately 5cm/2 inches apart for a 2 foot long strand of wire. At one end of the magnet wire, a double stranded-core wire is soldered on and heat-shrinked to protect it. A 2 x CR2032 coin cell holder with on/off switch is on the other side. Of course, if you want you can just cut the coin cell holder off and solder on a 3xAAA battery holder or 3xAA battery holder. To solder to the magnet wire, scrape off the coating first.Requires 2 x CR2032 batteries to run. Does not come with batteries, we do stock CR2032 batteries if you want to use them as is. Runs for about 8 hours continuously on two CR2032's.Please note: There are no series resistor installed in the strand, if you want to use another supply you will need to calculate and solder in a resistor. The reason that two 3V coin cells can be used to drive LEDs with a forward voltage of about 3.2V is that coin cells have an internal resistance that makes up for the lack of a choke resistor. If you want to drive these via a 6V power supply, you'll want to put in a 20-220 ohm (or larger) resistor in series to avoid burning out the LEDs. If you want to use a 4.5V power supply, use 10-100 ohms (or larger).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/896-00.jpg,/896.jpg,$4.95

Built in USB means you plug it in to program it, it just shows up - all you need is a Micro-B USB cable, no additional purchases are needed! We have a modified version of the Arduino IDE so Mac & Windows users can get started fast - or with the new 1.6.4+ Arduino IDE, it takes only a few seconds to add Flora-support. The FLORA has USB HID support, so it can act like a mouse or keyboard to attach directly to computers.FLORA has a small but easy to use onboard reset button to reboot the system. The power supply is designed to be flexible and easy to use. There is an onboard polarized 2 JST battery connector with protection schottky diode for use with external battery packs from 3.5v to 16v DC in. Can be used with LiIon/LiPoly, LiFe, alkaline or rechargeable NiMh/NiCad batteries of any size. The FLORA does not have a LiPo charger included by design, this allows safe use with multiple battery types and reduces risk of fire as it is not recommended to charge these batteries on fabric. We suggest one of our micro-lipo chargers if you want to use LiPo batteries with FLORA.FLORA has onboard power switch connected to 2A power FET for safe and efficient battery on/off control, so you can power quite a bit without burning out your switch. The FLORA has an onboard 3.3v 250mA regulator with a protection diode and USB fuse so that the microcontroller voltage is consistent and can power common 3.3v modules and sensors.We spent a lot of time on the power supply because the FLORA power system is specifically designed to allow easy control and power of a large quantity of addressable NeoPixels. Flora can easily drive 50 pixels directly from the onboard power supply, or up to 500 with the pixels externally powered by a separate 5V supply.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/659-07.jpg,/659.jpg,$14.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2090,"2.8"" TFT LCD with Cap Touch Breakout Board w/MicroSD Socket","Add some jazz & pizazz to your project with a color capactiveÂ touchscreen LCD. This TFT display is big (2.8"" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 240x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control, this has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a capacitive single-touch touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a resistive touchscreen version of this display breakout)This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit and SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 2 I2C pins are required for the touch screen controller.We wrapped up this display into an easy-to-use breakout board, with SPI connections on one end and 8-bit on the other. Both are 3-5V compliant with high-speed level shifters so you can use with any microcontroller. If you're going with SPI mode, you can also take advantage of the onboard MicroSD card socket to display images. (The microSD card not included, but any will work)Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"". For 8-bit interface fans we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text, and more. For SPI users, we have a library as well, its separate from the 8-bit library since both versions are heavily optimized.

This display is made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness!The driver chip, SSD1306 can communicate in two ways: I2C or SPI. The OLED itself require a 3.3V power supply and 3.3V logic levels for communication, but we include a 3.3V regulator and all pins are fully level shifted so you can use with 5V devices!The power requirements depend a little on how much of the display is lit but on average the display uses about 40mA from the 3.3V supply. Built into the OLED driver is a simple switch-cap charge pump that turns 3.3v-5v into a high voltage drive for the OLEDs.We have a detailed tutorial and example code in the form of an Arduino library for text and graphics. You'll need a microcontroller with more than 1K of RAM since the display must be buffered. The library can print text, bitmaps, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines.

We also have a version of this display breakout with a capacitive touchscreen.This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit and SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 4 pins are required for the touch screen (2 digital, 2 analog) or you can purchase and use our resistive touchscreen controller (not included) to use I2C or SPIWe wrapped up this display into an easy-to-use breakout board, with SPI connections on one end and 8-bit on the other. Both are 3-5V compliant with high-speed level shifters so you can use with any microcontroller. If you're going with SPI mode, you can also take advantage of the onboard MicroSD card socket to display images. (microSD card not included, but any will work)Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"".

It's aÂ 84x48 pixel monochrome LCD display. These displays are small, only about 1.5"" diagonal, but very readable and come with a white backlight. This display is made of 84x48 individual pixels, so you can use it for graphics, text or bitmaps. These displays are inexpensive, easy to use, require only a few digital I/O pins and are fairly low power as wellTo drive the display, you will need 3 to 5 digital output pins (depending on whether you want to manually control the chip select and reset lines). Another pin can be used to control (via on/off or PWM) the backlight - the backlight LEDs are wired to a transistor.The display driver is a PCD8544 chip, and it runs at 3.3V so you'll need a 3V supply handy (you don't need that much current though, maybe 10mA tops). Logic levels must be 3V to prevent damage but we include a free level shifter chip so you can easily connect it to 5V logic such as an Arduino.These screens are recycled from older cell phones so they often have tiny nicks or scratches. There's no such thing as a 'new' Nokia 5110 display, but the scratches are not noticeable when in use.Of course, we wouldn't just point you to a datasheet and say ""good luck!"" To make it easy for you to use the display, we've written a nice graphics library that can print text, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines!

Â The Resistive Touch Screen to USB Mouse Controller is a board thatÂ can handle analog to digital conversion. Â Most converters we've found are not very easy to use, and are 'fixed' - making them difficult to calibrate. The AR1100 is a nice chip that solves this problem by acting as a touch->USB converter and also comes with calibration software. The calibration software is Windows only, but once you've calibrated you can use the screen on any OS. The touch screen shows up as a USB mouse so no special drivers needed. We've tested it sucessfully on Mac, Windows, and Debian Linux (Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi). Other Linux distributions may or may not work, but if you're running Linux you're probably used to that.Â We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.This version comes in 1024x600 instead ofÂ the more expensive 1280x800 display.Â It's also not IPS so it's not good for wide-angle visibility.There's a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It tries to auto-detect which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu which to display.To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI output.For use with a Raspberry Pi we suggest editingÂ config.txtÂ to set the HDMI to the native 1024x600 in case it doesn't detect the resolution properly.

But how to keep an enclosure weather/waterproof while still attaching cables for power, data or sensors? That's where cable glands come in. By installing these over the cable, they form-fit to make a seal, keeping your project box innards safe from the outdoors.

We have two sizes, the PG-7 size is good for cables 0.118"" to 0.169"" diameter and this one, theÂ PG-9 size, which is good for 0.158"" - 0.252"" diameter. These two are the most common sizes for power & data cables, be sure to measure them so you have the proper fit.

As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. We also have a version of this display breakout with a capacitive touchscreen.This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit and SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 4 pins are required for the touch screen (2 digital, 2 analog) or you can purchase and use our resistive touchscreen controller (not included) to use I2C or SPIWe wrapped up this display into an easy-to-use breakout board, with SPI connections on one end and 8-bit on the other. Both are 3-5V compliant with high-speed level shifters so you can use with any microcontroller. If you're going with SPI mode, you can also take advantage of the onboard MicroSD card socket to display images. (microSD card not included, but any will work)Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"". For 8-bit interface fans we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text, and more. For SPI users, we have a library as well, its separate from the 8-bit library since both versions are heavily optimized. We also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure) and example code to demonstrate all of it.Follow our step by step guide for wiring, code and drawing.

Ah, if only you had this triple-axis accelerometer/magnetometer compass module. Inside are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity). The other is a magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. By combining this data you can then orient your project!We based this breakout on the latest version of this popular sensor, the LSM303DLHC. This compact sensor uses I2C to communicate and its very easy to use. Since it's a 3.3V max chip, we added circuitry to make it 5V-safe logic and power, for easy use with either 3 or 5V microcontrollers. Simply connect VCC to +3-5V and ground to ground. Then read data from the I2C clock and data pins. There's also a Data Ready and two Interrupt pins you can use (check the LSM303 datasheet for details)If using with an Arduino, its extra-easy to get started as we already wrote a nice little Arduino library to get you started. Simply download our library and connect the SCL pin to your Arduino's I2C clock pin, and SDA pin to your Arduino's I2C data pin and upload our test program to read out accelerometer and magnetic field data.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1120-00.jpg,1120.jpg,$14.95

This charger is a very unique design, perfect for outdoor projects, or DIY iPod chargers. We've spent over a year testing and tinkering with this charger to come up with a plug and play solution to charging batteries with the sun and we're really pleased with what we ended up with.Easy to use! Pick up any of our many 3.7V/4.2V LiIon batteries, and a 6V solar panel. Plug the battery into the BATT port using a 2-pin JST cable and the solar panel into the DC jack using a 2.1mm adapter cable Put the solar panel outside (and keep the battery out of the sun, it needs to be kept cool!) to start charging. You can power another project like a Mintyboost at the same time by connecting to the LOAD output portOur carefully designed charger is designed specifically for solar charging, and will automatically draw the most current possible from the panel in any light condition! Even thought it isn't a 'true' MPPT (max power point tracker), it has near-identical performance without the additional cost of a buck-converter.

This TFT display is big (2.8"" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 240x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control, this has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a capacitive single-touch touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a resistive touchscreen version of this display breakout)This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The display can be used in two modes: 8-bit and SPI. For 8-bit mode, you'll need 8 digital data lines and 4 or 5 digital control lines to read and write to the display (12 lines total). SPI mode requires only 5 pins total (SPI data in, data out, clock, select, and d/c) but is slower than 8-bit mode. In addition, 2 I2C pins are required for the touch screen controller.We wrapped up this display into an easy-to-use breakout board, with SPI connections on one end and 8-bit on the other. Both are 3-5V compliant with high-speed level shifters so you can use with any microcontroller. If you're going with SPI mode, you can also take advantage of the onboard MicroSD card socket to display images. (The microSD card not included, but any will work)Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"". For 8-bit interface fans we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text, and more. For SPI users, we have a library as well, its separate from the 8-bit library since both versions are heavily optimized.

http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651,"2.8"" TFT Touch Shield for Arduino with Resistive Touch Screen","Spice up your Arduino project with a beautiful large touchscreen display shield with built in microSD card connection. This TFT display is big (2.8"" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful (18-bit 262,000 different shades)! 240x320 pixels with individual pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a capacitive-touch version of this shield here)We've updated our original v1 shield to an SPI display - its a tiny bit slower but uses a lot less pins and is now much easier to use with Mega & Leonardo. We also include an SPI touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. Even with all the extras, the price is lower thanks to our parts sourcing & engineering skillz!The shield is fully assembled, tested and ready to go. No wiring, no soldering! Simply plug it in and load up our library - you'll have it running in under 10 minutes! Works best with any classic Arduino (UNO/Duemilanove/Diecimila). Solder three jumpers and you can use it at full speed on a Leonardo or Mega as well.This display shield has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. This shield needs fewer pins than our v1 shield, so you can connect more sensors, buttons and LEDs: 5 SPI pins for the display, another pin for the SPI touchscreen controller and another pin for uSD card if you want to read images off of it.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles and text. We also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure) and example code to demonstrate all of it. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller!For people who want the same screen but not in a shield form-factor, check out our 2.8"" TFT breakout",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1651-00.jpg,1651.jpg,$34.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/328,Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 2500mAh,"The included protection circuitry keeps the battery voltage from going too high (over-charging) or low (over-use) which means that the battery will cut-out when completely dead at ~2.8V. It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 1200mA or less.Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1/2C or even less - 1200mA max in this case. Even 500mA is a good charge rate, which is how much you can get from a USB port.Additional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery. As with all Lithium ion polymer batteries and with any power source - they should be used by experts who are comfortable working with power supplies.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/328-02.jpg,/328.jpg,$14.95

These displays have 40-pin Flex PCB (FPC) cables and often require a boost converter for the backlight LED, which makes them annoying to breadboard. To make them breadboardable, we stuck a 40-pin FPC and a FAN5333-based backlight driver with adjustable current onto a labeled breakout board. Now you can poke and probe each pin!The backlight driver defaults to 25mA and can boost up to 24VDC for up to 7-LED strings. Check your display datasheet for the string configuration, and short out the jumpers to increase the backlight current.Comes with one assembled and tested PCB. Header and TFT display is not included! We have 4.3"" with touchscreen and 5.0"" (with  and without touchscreen) displays in the shop that work well with this.

A 2.1mm adapter cable is also required to adapt a solar panel to the DC power jack.Make your projects to go green this summer with our specialized USB/Solar Lithium Ion Polymer Battery charger! This charger is a very unique design, perfect for outdoor projects, or DIY iPod chargers. We've spent over a year testing and tinkering with this charger to come up with a plug and play solution to charging batteries with the sun and we're really pleased with what we ended up with.Easy to use! Pick up any of our many 3.7V/4.2V LiIon batteries, and a 6V solar panel. Plug the battery into the BATT port using a 2-pin JST cable and the solar panel into the DC jack using a 2.1mm adapter cable Put the solar panel outside (and keep the battery out of the sun, it needs to be kept cool!) to start charging. You can power another project like a Mintyboost at the same time by connecting to the LOAD output portOur carefully designed charger is designed specifically for solar charging, and will automatically draw the most current possible from the panel in any light condition! Even thought it isn't a 'true' MPPT (max power point tracker), it has near-identical performance without the additional cost of a buck-converter. Our detailed tutorial on how to use this charger includes a design document explaining how it all works.For use with Adafruit Lipoly/LiIon batteries only! Other batteries may have different voltage, chemistry, polarity or pinout.Comes with an assembled charger board, a 2-pin JST cable that will fit into either the BATT or LOAD ports, and a large stabilization capacitor that must be installed in your finished project.

If you want to use this with a higher voltage, say 12V or 24V, simply add a 1K ohm resistor in series with the LED cathodes to keep the LED current at around 20mA. You can PWM the RGB pins to make any color you like.This button is a momentary push button, when you press it the 'normally-open' contact shorts to the common contact.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/4237,Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with Short Cable - 3.7V 350mAh,"The included protection circuitry keeps the battery voltage from going too high (over-charging) or low (over-use) which means that the battery will cut-out when completely dead at 3.0V. It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 350mA or less. We suggest our Micro Lipo charger, which has a 100mA default rate. Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1 C or even less - 100 to 350mA is a good rate, and available from any USB port if using a USB-powered chargerAdditional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery. As with all Lithium ion polymer batteries and with any power source - they should be used by experts who are comfortable working with power supplies.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4237-01.jpg,4237.jpg,$5.95

We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes them ideal for use with 3.3V projects that have a 2-pin JST connector meant for one of our Li-Ion/Poly batteries. (Of course, you can't recharge them like Li-Ion/Polys, so don't try to plug this into one of our Li-Ion/Poly charger boards!)Fits any standard AAA battery. When using rechargeable NiMH the output voltage will range from about 3.7V with charged batteries to 2.7V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of 3.6V. When using alkalines, the output will range from 4.6V with new batteries to 3.3V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of about 4.5VThe polarity matches that of our 2-pin JST cable and Li-Ion/Poly batteries.

Â Just like the charger doctor, you can use this meter to find out if your voltage is too low or your current draw is too high.

Use the USB In-Line Voltage and Current Meter to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.025 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. This voltage meter has anÂ OLED display that shows off voltage, watts, amps, and mAH and instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones. Â There's a button on the back that allows you to flip the display 180Â° for easier reading.

You can use this device from 3.7-13VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. Â It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices above 7VDC, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator or our Charger Doctor for a less expensive version that can handle less voltage.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2690-08.jpg,2690.jpg,$19.95

If you're really like me, you've wanted the sensor to come with a low current draw and on a tiny carrier board with all of the external components required to make it work.The Pololu Carrier with Sharp GP2Y0D810Z0F Digital Distance Sensor fits those both needs and more. it's one of Sharp's fastest distance sensors - with a sample rate of almost 400 Hz and is an attractive alternative to short range phototransistors and longer range analog distance sensors.Output is high normally and low when the sensor detects an object. This sensor only tells if the object's nearby - not how near or far the sensor is - so they're great for break-beam, obstacle detection, and object counting.This sensor comes with a 3-pin male header and a 3-pin right-angle male header. You can connect these pins with a servo cable. The square pad is ground, middle is VIN, and the remaining pad is output.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/4311,"2.0"" 320x240 Color IPS TFT Display with microSD Card Breakout","This gorgeous IPS display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project, with excellent visibility from any angle. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!The 2.0"" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! Not only that, but its an IPS display for vivid color and high-angle visibility. The TFT driver (ST7789) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades), but almost all drivers will use just 16-bit color. The TFT will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator, auto-reset circuitry, and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller! Wiring is easy, we strongly encourage using the hardware SPI pins of your Arduino as software SPI is noticeably slower when dealing with this size display.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4311-06.jpg,4311.jpg,$19.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/893,Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Warm White LEDs + Coin Cell Holder,"Add sparkle to your project with these lovely silver wire LED strands. These strands are very interesting, they use two silver wires that are coated so they don't short if they touch, then tiny 1000mcd LEDs are bonded onto the wires and coated with epoxy. The result is a very flexible silver wire with sparkly ""fairy"" lights that are much less visible than normal LEDs. They're still just LEDs, but in a fun new form-factor! They're even waterproof - you can dunk these or have them outdoors, just be sure to protect the battery holder.Each strand comes with 12 LEDs, approximately 5cm/2 inches apart for a 2 foot long strand of wire. At one end of the magnet wire, a double stranded-core wire is soldered on and heat-shrinked to protect it. A 2 x CR2032 coin cell holder with on/off switch is on the other side. Of course, if you want you can just cut the coin cell holder off and solder on a 3xAAA battery holder or 3xAA battery holder. To solder to the magnet wire, scrape off the coating first.Requires 2 x CR2032 batteries to run. Does not come with batteries, we do stock CR2032 batteries if you want to use them as is. Runs for about 8 hours continuously on two CR2032's.Please note: There are no series resistor installed in the strand, if you want to use another supply you will need to calculate and solder in a resistor. The reason that two 3V coin cells can be used to drive LEDs with a forward voltage of about 3.2V is that coin cells have an internal resistance that makes up for the lack of a choke resistor. If you want to drive these via a 6V power supply, you'll want to put in a 20-220 ohm (or larger) resistor in series to avoid burning out the LEDs. If you want to use a 4.5V power supply, use 10-100 ohms (or larger).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/893-00.jpg,/893.jpg,$4.95

There are 60 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for you.The strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 0.65""/1.7cm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need! We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meter (depending on use) and a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 4 meters (depending on use) You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThey come in 4 meter reels with a 2 or 3-pin JST SM connector on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips are sold by the meter! If you buy 4 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 4m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.Â If the piece comes from the end of the reel, the connector may be on the output end of the strip!To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

http://www.adafruit.com/products/1790,"Adafruit ""Music Maker"" MP3 Shield for Arduino (MP3/Ogg/WAV...)","Bend all audio files to your will with the Adafruit Music Maker shield for Arduino! This powerful shield features the VS1053, an encoding/decoding (codec) chip that can decode a wide variety of audio formats such as MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, WMA, MIDI, FLAC, WAV (PCM and ADPCM). It can also be used to record audio in both PCM (WAV) and compressed Ogg Vorbis. You can do all sorts of stuff with the audio as well such as adjusting bass, treble, and volume digitally.All this functionality is implemented in a light-weight SPI interface so that any Arduino can play audio from an SD card. There's also a special MIDI mode that you can boot the chip into that will read 'classic' 31250Kbaud MIDI data from an Arduino pin and act like a synth/drum machine - there are dozens of built-in drum and sample effects! But the chip is a pain to solder, and needs a lot of extras. That's why we spun up the best shield, perfect for use with any Arduino Uno, Leonardo or Mega.This version of the shield only has stereo line/headphone output. We also have a version with a 3W/channel class-D stereo speaker amplifier for easy use in projects that need to be loudWe believe this is the best MP3 playing shield you can get, and at a great price too.

We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes them ideal for use with 3.3V projects that have a 2-pin JST connector meant for one of our Li-Ion/Poly batteries. (Of course, you can't recharge them like Li-Ion/Polys, so don't try to plug this into one of our Li-Ion/Poly charger boards!)Fits any standard AAA battery. When using rechargeable NiMH the output voltage will range from about 3.7V with charged batteries to 2.7V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of 3.6V. When using alkalines, the output will range from 4.6V with new batteries to 3.3V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of about 4.5VThe polarity matches that of our 2-pin JST cable and Li-Ion/Poly batteries.

This type of speaker does not have a moving cone like most speakers you've seen. Instead, a small metal rod is wrapped with the voice coil. When current is pulsed through the coil, the magnetic field causes a piece of metal to expand and contract - and if it's pressed against a surface it turns the transducer into a speaker!Often these size transducers are pressed up against a flat surface to turn it into a sounding board. The effect is a surprisingly clear sound that comes from the surface itself. The body of the transducer is heavy so that it can be placed with theÂ top down on a table. And for another fun trick, put the transducer at the end of a large plastic cup to point sound in a particular direction.This transducer is about 28mm in diameter and has 4Î© impedence and should be run at about 3W.

Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!The 2.2"" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340 or compatible) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades!). And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1727,Thermocouple Amplifier with 1-Wire Breakout Board - MAX31850K,"Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a cold-compensation reference. So far we've carried the very nice MAX31855 which is an SPI interface thermocouple amplifier. The '855 is great but if you have a lot of thermocouples to measure it isn't terribly easy to use. That's why we are also carrying the new '850 model from Maxim - it's a ""1-Wire"" thermocouple amp which can have any number of breakouts on a single shared I/O line.The MAX31850K does everything for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller that has 1-Wire support. This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator with 10uF bypass capacitors all assembled and tested. This board can be used with 'parasitic power' - where the power is on the data line - or with 'local power' where the power for the converter comes in on the Vin Pin.Please note: this board does not have level shifting on the 3V Data line - we did this on purpose so that it can be used in parasitic mode. The data line must be level shifted to 3V - our 4-channel shifter works wonderfully for level shifting 1-Wire and you only need one at the '1-Wire host' for all thermocouples on the shared data line.The MAX31850K data format is very similar to that of the well known 1-Wire DS18B20 temp sensor but it is not drop in compatible without code changes to check for the new '1 Wire family' type. We have adapted the classic Arduino OneWire and DallasTemp libraries to be MAX31850 compatible, so please click on those links to grab our libraries.Comes with a 2 pin terminal block (for connecting to the thermocouple), 4.7K data line pullup resistor, and pin header (to plug into any breadboard or perfboard). Goes great with our 1m K-type thermocouple. Not for use with any other kind of thermocouple, K type only!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1727-00.jpg,1727.jpg,$14.95

It's aÂ 84x48 pixel monochrome LCD display. These displays are small, only about 1.5"" diagonal, but very readable and come with a white backlight. This display is made of 84x48 individual pixels, so you can use it for graphics, text or bitmaps. These displays are inexpensive, easy to use, require only a few digital I/O pins and are fairly low power as wellTo drive the display, you will need 3 to 5 digital output pins (depending on whether you want to manually control the chip select and reset lines). Another pin can be used to control (via on/off or PWM) the backlight - the backlight LEDs are wired to a transistor.The display driver is a PCD8544 chip, and it runs at 3.3V so you'll need a 3V supply handy (you don't need that much current though, maybe 10mA tops). Logic levels must be 3V to prevent damage but we include a free level shifter chip so you can easily connect it to 5V logic such as an Arduino.These screens are recycled from older cell phones so they often have tiny nicks or scratches. There's no such thing as a 'new' Nokia 5110 display, but the scratches are not noticeable when in use.Of course, we wouldn't just point you to a datasheet and say ""good luck!"" To make it easy for you to use the display, we've written a nice graphics library that can print text, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines!

It doesn't contain an actual UV sensing element, instead it approximates it based on visible & IR light from the sun. We took this outside a couple days and compared the calculated UV index with the news-reported index and found it was very accurate! It's a digital sensor that works over I2C so just about any microcontroller can use it. The sensor also has individual visible and IR sensing elements so you can measure just about any kind of light - we only wrote our library to printout the 'counts' rather than the calculate the exact values of IR and Visible light so if you need precision Lux measurement check out the TSL2561. If you're feeling really advanced, you can connect up an IR LED to the LED pin and use the basic proximity sensor capability that is in the SI1145 as well.We wrapped this nice little sensor up on a PCB with level shifting and regulation circuitry so you can safely use it with 3 or 5V microcontrollers. If you are using an Arduino, we've got a lovely tutorial and library already written up with example code so you can quickly read sensor readings and the UV index in under 10 minutes. Each order comes with one fully assembled and tested PCB breakout and a small piece of header. You'll need to solder the header onto the PCB but it's fairly easy and takes only a few minutes even for a beginner.Â ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1777-00.jpg,1777.jpg,$9.95

It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 420mA or less. We suggest our Micro Lipo charger, which has a 100mA default rate. Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1 C or even less - 100 to 420mA is a good rate, and available from any USB port if using a USB-powered chargerAdditional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1459,Inductive Charging Set - 3.3V @ 500mA max,"The squarish board with two chips on it is the transmitter (power with 9V). Â The longer board is the output andÂ you can connect that to the part ofÂ your project that needs powering.

Inductive charging is a way of powering a device without a direct wire connection. Most people have seen inductive charging in a rechargable electric toothbrush: you may have noticed that you recharge it by placing it into the holder, but there's no direct plug. These chargers work by taking a power transformer and splitting it in half, an AC waveform is generated into one, and couples into the second coil.

This is a basic charger set, and it does work, providing 3.3V DC output from the output half when the input half is powered with 9V to 12VDC. You can draw as much as 500mA if the coils are 2 or 3 mm apart. If you only need 100 or 200mA you can be up 7mm apart. For 10mA draw, the coils can be up to half an inch (12.5mm) apart. Any non-ferrous/non-conductive material (eg air, wood, leather, plastic, paper, glass) can be used between the two coils. The material doesn't affect the distance or efficiency. The coils do need to be fairly co-axial, try to get them to be parallel and have the circles line up for best power-transfer. (This is why the electric toothbrush must fit into the plastic holder, it's lining up the two coils for best efficiency.)

Because it's an air-core transformer, it's fairly inefficient. Only about 40% of the energy in shows up on the other end, but for low power or charging project. If you draw 5V 100mA on the output side (0.5W), you'll need 0.5W * 2.5 / 9V = ~150mA from the input end. The quiescent current is about 70mA at all time, even when the other coil is not anywhere near by.

These are basic modules, probably used for some low cost toy. We don't have any datasheets or specifications for them. We do see a feedback resistor divider on the output side using 0603 SMT resistors so an advanced user could solder in different values to turn it into a different valued output.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1459-02.jpg,1459.jpg,$9.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1480,"2.2"" 18-bit color TFT LCD display with microSD card breakout","This lovely little display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!The 2.2"" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340 or compatible) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades!). And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller! Wiring is easy, we strongly encourage using the hardware SPI pins of your Arduino as software SPI is noticeably slower when dealing with this size display.

http://adafruit.com/product/4237,Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with Short Cable - 3.7V 350mAh,"The included protection circuitry keeps the battery voltage from going too high (over-charging) or low (over-use) which means that the battery will cut-out when completely dead at 3.0V. It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 350mA or less. We suggest our Micro Lipo charger, which has a 100mA default rate. Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1 C or even less - 100 to 350mA is a good rate, and available from any USB port if using a USB-powered chargerAdditional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery. As with all Lithium ion polymer batteries and with any power source - they should be used by experts who are comfortable working with power supplies.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4237-01.jpg,4237.jpg,$5.95

Simply drill a 16mm hole into any material up to 1/2"" thick and you can fit these in place, there's even a rubber gasket to keep water out of the enclosure. On the front of the button is a flat metal actuator, surrounded by a white plastic LED ring. On the back there are 3 contacts for the button (common, normally-open and normally-closed) and 2 for the white LED ring (+ and -). Connect 3 to 6V to the LED to have it light up nicely, there's a built in resistor! If you want to use this with a higher voltage, say 12V or 24V, simply add a 470 ohm resistor in series with the LED connection to keep the LED current at around 20mA.This button is a momentary push button, when you press it the 'normally-open' contact shorts to the common contact.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/519,Conductive Rubber Cord Stretch Sensor + extras!,"Measuring stretch forces isn't easy - unless you have some conductive rubber cord! This cord is 2mm diameter, and 1 meter long, made of carbon-black impregnated rubber. Usually this material is used for EMF gasketing, but its also very fun to play with.In a 'relaxed' state, the resistance is about 350 ohms per inch. As you pull on it, the resistance increases (the particles get further apart). As you stretch it out, the resistance increases. So lets say you have a 6"" piece - thats about 2.1 Kohms. Stretch it to 10"" long and now it is 10""/6""*2.1K = 3.5 Kohms. You can stretch the rubber about 50-70% longer than the resting length, so a 6"" piece shouldn't be stretched more than 10"". Once the force is released, the rubber will shrink back, although its not very 'fast' and it takes a minute or two to revert to its original length. It's not a true linear sensor, and the resistance may vary from batch to batch, so we consider it a way to measure stretching motion but isn't really precise.This stuff is fun, so we give you a full meter and also two alligator clips (to connect to the cord) and a 10K resistor. Together, you can use these to make a simple voltage divider. Then use our handy Thermistor tutorial to measure the analog voltage and convert that back to resistance.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/519-03.jpg,/519.jpg,$9.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/801,Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate Kit for Raspberry Pi,"We added lots of basic but essential goodies. First up, there's a big prototyping area, half of which is 'breadboard' style and half of which is 'perfboard' style so you can wire up DIP chips, sensors, and the like. Along the edges of the proto area, all the GPIO/I2C/SPI and power pins are broken out to 0.1"" stips so you can easily connect to them. On the edges of the prototyping area, (almost all of) the breakout pins are also connected to labeled 3.5mm screw-terminal blocks. This makes it easy to semi-permanently wire in sensors, LEDs, etc. There's also a 4-block terminal block broken out to 0.1"" pads for general non-GPIO wiring. Finally, we had a little space remaining over the metal connectors so we put in an SOIC surface mount chip breakout area, for those chips that dont come in DIP format.This kit comes as a set of parts, a little soldering is required to put it together but its really easy, even a beginner can do it in 15-20 minutes or so. The Pi (and our kits) are meant to help us all learn skills, soldering is fun! Check out our tutorial for how to assembleThe nice thing about this plate is we're getting custom header breakouts that are taller than usual, so that the proto plate sits above the metal connectors, out of the way and allows for plenty of workspace. It fits in our Pi Box enclosure with access to the terminal blocks so you can keep the Pi safe while prototyping. We'll have stackable header kits as well for those who want to put multiple plates on top.For more information, including some usage ideas check out our Proto Pi Plate tutorial",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/801-08.jpg,/801.jpg,$15.95

https://www.adafruit.com/products/1616,Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver PCB for 4x4 Keypad & 3mm LEDs,"This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. Trellis is an open source backlight keypad driver system. It is easy to use, works with any 3mm LEDs and eight tiles can be tiled together on a shared I2C bus.This PCB is specially made to match the Adafruit 4x4 elastomer keypad. Each Trellis PCB has 4x4 pads and 4x4 matching spots for 3mm LEDs. The circuitry on-board handles the background key-presses and LED lighting for the 4x4 tile. However, it does not have any microcontroller or other 'brains' - an Arduino (or similar microcontroller) is required to control the Trellis to read the keypress data and let it know when to light up LEDs as desired.Each tile has an I2C-controlled LED sequencer and keypad reader already on it. The chip can control all 16 LEDs individually, turning them on or off. It cannot do grayscale or dimming. The same chip also reads any keypresses made with the rubber keypad. The connections are 'diode multiplexed' so you do not have to worry about ""ghosting"" when pressing multiple keys, each key is uniquely addressed.The tiles have 3 address jumpers. You can tile up to 8 PCBs together (for a total of 4x32 or 16x8=128 buttons/leds) on a single I2C bus, as long as each one has a unique address. All the tiles connect by the edges with solder, and share the same power, ground, interrupt, and i2c clock/data pins. So, you can easily set up to 128 LEDs and read up to 128 buttons using only 2 I2C wires! The tiles can be arranged in any configuration they want as long as each tile is connected to another with the 5 edge-fingers.Each LED is multiplexed with a constant-current driver, so you can mix and match any colors you like. You don't need it to be all blue, all red, etc. Mix it up! Any 3mm LED can be used, although we find that diffused LEDs with 250mcd+ brightness look best.This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. You'll probably want to pick up a matching button pad and also some 3mm diffused LEDs (we suggest red, blue or white which look best). Some soldering is required to put the LEDs into the PCB, and then attach wires that go from each Trellis to an Arduino microcontroller (or whatever microcontroller you prefer)We have an Arduino library & example code on github.We have a great tutorial with wiring diagrams, installation instructions and example code here",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1616-00.jpg,1616.jpg,$9.95

With the backlight off, the decoder and display itself draws 250mA. If you want more backlight control, there's a PWM input, connect that to your microcontroller or other PWM output and you can continuously dim the backlight as desired",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2219-01.jpg,2219.jpg,$29.95
https://www.adafruit.com/product/1932,40-pin TFT Friend - FPC Breakout with LED Backlight Driver,"This breakout board is something we designed in-house to help us work with 'dot-clock' 40-pin TFT displays that require the RGB pixel data to be clocked in continuously. These displays have 40-pin Flex PCB (FPC) cables and often require a boost converter for the backlight LED, which makes them annoying to breadboard. To make them breadboardable, we stuck a 40-pin FPC and a FAN5333-based backlight driver with adjustable current onto a labeled breakout board. Now you can poke and probe each pin!The backlight driver defaults to 25mA and can boost up to 24VDC for up to 7-LED strings. Check your display datasheet for the string configuration, and short out the jumpers to increase the backlight current.Comes with one assembled and tested PCB. Header and TFT display is not included! We have 4.3"" with touchscreen and 5.0"" (with  and without touchscreen) displays in the shop that work well with this. The 4.3"" tend to like 25mA backlight drive, the 5.0"" look good with 50mA backlight.We don't have a tutorial on using this breakout or how to interface with these displays and you must have a processor that can drive the display!

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1713,Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX9814 with Auto Gain Control,"Add an ear to your project with this well-designed electret microphone amplifier with AGC. This fully assembled and tested board comes with a 20-20KHz electret microphone soldered on. For the amplification, we use the Maxim MAX9814, a specialty chip that is designed for amplifying electret microphones in situations where the loudness of the audio isn't predictable.This fancy microphone amplifier module is a step above the rest, with built in automatic gain control. The AGC in the amplifier means that nearby 'loud' sounds will be quieted so they don't overwhelm & 'clip' the amplifier, and even quiet, far-away sounds will be amplified. This amplifier is great for when you want to record or detect audio in a setting where levels change and you don't want to have to tweak the amplifier gain all the time.The chip at the heart of this amp is the MAX9814, and has a few options you can configure with the breakout. The default 'max gain' is 60dB, but can be set to 40dB or 50dB by jumpering the Gain pin to VCC or ground. You can also change the Attack/Release ratio, from the default 1:4000 to 1:2000 or 1:500. The ouput from the amp is about 2Vpp max on a 1.25V DC bias, so it can be easily used with any Analog/Digital converter that is up to 3.3V input. If you want to pipe it into a Line Input, just use a 1-100uF blocking capacitor in series (100uF sounds best).For audio-reactive projects, we suggest using an FFT driver library (such as the one in this library) which can take the audio input and 'translate' it into frequencies. If you just need to keep track of audio levels, see our sound-level meter tutorial for ArduinoEach order comes with one assembled and tested board, with electret mic pre-soldered on, and a small piece of header. Our tutorial will get you started with using and testing the microphone amplifier and you can check out our general-purpose microphone amplifier tutorial for other project ideas and code.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1713-00.jpg,1713.jpg,$7.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/772,LCD Shield Kit w/ 16x2 Character Display - Only 2 pins used! - BLUE AND WHITE,"This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the Blue & White 16x2 LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another pin to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's almost half of the pins available on a classic Arduino!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a shield that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Arduino! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.This shield is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The shield is designed for 'classic' Arduinos such as the Uno, Duemilanove, Diecimilla, etc. It uses the I2C pins at Analog 4 and Analog 5. It will also work perfectly with Arduino Mega R3's which have the extra SDA/SCL I2C pins broken out. Earlier Mega's have the I2C pins in a different location and will require you to solder two wires from the I2C pins on the shield and plug them into the different I2C locations at Digital 20 & 21.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality, USA-made PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). This product comes with a 16x2 Blue & White LCD. Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasingOf course, we even wrote an easy-to-use Arduino library that you can easily add to your project. It acts just like the built in LiquidCrystal library, but automatically uses the shield pins. You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the library and shield can control the backlight of our character LCDs by turning the LED on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this shield can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/772-03.jpg,/772.jpg,$19.95

These little extra-small mini heat sinks are easy to use and give you an extra thermal boost. They're also a great deal, you get a pack of 10 in each order!

The heat sink is a 0.25"" x 0.25"" (6.5mm x 6.5mm) square with 9 little 'fins' sticking out the top. The total height is 0.15"" (3.65mm) so it will fit in any case or enclosure. They even come with a bit of thermal tape already on the bottom! Ideal for medium flat BGAs, TSSOPs, QFNs, etc!

We do not have a datasheet for these heat sinks, but we believe the thermal resistance is approximately 90ÂºC/W

We have a modified version of the Arduino IDE so Mac & Windows users can get started fast - or with the new 1.6.4+ Arduino IDE, it takes only a few seconds to add Flora-support. The FLORA has USB HID support, so it can act like a mouse or keyboard to attach directly to computers.FLORA has a small but easy to use onboard reset button to reboot the system. The power supply is designed to be flexible and easy to use. There is an onboard polarized 2 JST battery connector with protection schottky diode for use with external battery packs from 3.5v to 16v DC in. Can be used with LiIon/LiPoly, LiFe, alkaline or rechargeable NiMh/NiCad batteries of any size. The FLORA does not have a LiPo charger included by design, this allows safe use with multiple battery types and reduces risk of fire as it is not recommended to charge these batteries on fabric. We suggest one of our micro-lipo chargers if you want to use LiPo batteries with FLORA.FLORA has onboard power switch connected to 2A power FET for safe and efficient battery on/off control, so you can power quite a bit without burning out your switch. The FLORA has an onboard 3.3v 250mA regulator with a protection diode and USB fuse so that the microcontroller voltage is consistent and can power common 3.3v modules and sensors.We spent a lot of time on the power supply because the FLORA power system is specifically designed to allow easy control and power of a large quantity of addressable NeoPixels. Flora can easily drive 50 pixels directly from the onboard power supply, or up to 500 with the pixels externally powered by a separate 5V supply.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/659-07.jpg,/659.jpg,$14.95

Hardware SPI support is handy but not required. This makes them excellent for use with any microcontroller or microprocessor, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Propeller, SparkCore, and any 'raw' microcontrollers/microprocessors.

This type of speaker does not have a moving cone like most speakers you've seen. Instead, a small metal rod is wrapped with the voice coil. When current is pulsed through the coil, the magnetic field causes a piece of metal to expand and contract - and if it's pressed against a surface it turns the transducer into a speaker!Often these size transducers are pressed up against a flat surface to turn it into a sounding board. The effect is a surprisingly clear sound that comes from the surface itself. The body of the transducer is heavy so that it can be placed with theÂ top down on a table. And for another fun trick, put the transducer at the end of a large plastic cup to point sound in a particular direction.This transducer is about 28mm in diameter and has 4Î© impedence and should be run at about 3W.

Since it's class D, its completely cool-running, no heat sinks are required and it's extremely efficient - up to 93% efficiency makes it great for portable or battery powered rigs.We like the MAX9744 amplifier at the heart of this board because its very easy to use, but it also has both analog and digital volume control capability. Use a single 1KÎ© pot (we include one) to adjust volume analog-style. Or hook it up to your favorite microcontroller and send I2C commands to set 64-steps of volume amplification.Some great stats about the MAX9744:",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1752-00.jpg,1752.jpg,$19.95

http://adafruit.com/product/2821,Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266 - Loose Headers,At the Feather HUZZAH's heart is an ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller clocked at 80 MHz and at 3.3V logic. This microcontroller contains a Tensilica chip core as well as a full WiFi stack. You can program the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE for an easy-to-run Internet of Things core. We wired up a high-quality SiLabs CP2104 USB-Serial chip that can upload code at a blistering 921600 baud for fast development time. It also has auto-reset so no noodling with pins and reset button pressings. The CP2104 has better driver support than the CH340 and can do very high speeds without stability issues.,https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2821-05.jpg,2821.jpg,$16.95
http://adafruit.com/product/801,Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate Kit for Raspberry Pi,"We added lots of basic but essential goodies. First up, there's a big prototyping area, half of which is 'breadboard' style and half of which is 'perfboard' style so you can wire up DIP chips, sensors, and the like. Along the edges of the proto area, all the GPIO/I2C/SPI and power pins are broken out to 0.1"" stips so you can easily connect to them. On the edges of the prototyping area, (almost all of) the breakout pins are also connected to labeled 3.5mm screw-terminal blocks. This makes it easy to semi-permanently wire in sensors, LEDs, etc. There's also a 4-block terminal block broken out to 0.1"" pads for general non-GPIO wiring. Finally, we had a little space remaining over the metal connectors so we put in an SOIC surface mount chip breakout area, for those chips that dont come in DIP format.This kit comes as a set of parts, a little soldering is required to put it together but its really easy, even a beginner can do it in 15-20 minutes or so. The Pi (and our kits) are meant to help us all learn skills, soldering is fun! Check out our tutorial for how to assembleThe nice thing about this plate is we're getting custom header breakouts that are taller than usual, so that the proto plate sits above the metal connectors, out of the way and allows for plenty of workspace. It fits in our Pi Box enclosure with access to the terminal blocks so you can keep the Pi safe while prototyping. We'll have stackable header kits as well for those who want to put multiple plates on top.For more information, including some usage ideas check out our Proto Pi Plate tutorial",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/801-08.jpg,/801.jpg,$15.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1494,Cold Splice Wire Tap (UB) - 10 pack,"Kiss those days of heat-shrink, melted jacketing and clumsily-arranged third-hand tools goodbye! Go 'cold splice' with these snap-able plastic splices for fast connections. Use with any 22-26 AWG solid core wire and slip them into the plastic splice so that they slide into the metal teeth. Then squeeze down with parallel-jaw or slip joint pliers - don't use needle-noses, they have too much angle and not enough force. We also like using our panavise to squeeze them down.

This is a wire-tap splice. You can slide one half over an existing 22-26 AWG solid-core wire and then 'tap' into it with another wire. It's an easy way to tap into an existing wire without doing weird cut-solder surgery.

The splices contain a little silicone jelly to keep the cold splice from oxidizing so they are a bit weatherproof. They are not waterproof.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2964,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 60 LED/m - BLACK,"There are 60 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 0.66""/17mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 4 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 4 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 4m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

This TFT display is big (2.8"" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful (18-bit 262,000 different shades)! 240x320 pixels with individual pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a capacitive-touch version of this shield here)We've updated our original v1 shield to an SPI display - its a tiny bit slower but uses a lot less pins and is now much easier to use with Mega & Leonardo. We also include an SPI touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. Even with all the extras, the price is lower thanks to our parts sourcing & engineering skillz!The shield is fully assembled, tested and ready to go. No wiring, no soldering! Simply plug it in and load up our library - you'll have it running in under 10 minutes! Works best with any classic Arduino (UNO/Duemilanove/Diecimila). Solder three jumpers and you can use it at full speed on a Leonardo or Mega as well.This display shield has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. This shield needs fewer pins than our v1 shield, so you can connect more sensors, buttons and LEDs: 5 SPI pins for the display, another pin for the SPI touchscreen controller and another pin for uSD card if you want to read images off of it.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles and text. We also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure) and example code to demonstrate all of it. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller!For people who want the same screen but not in a shield form-factor, check out our 2.8"" TFT breakout",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1651-00.jpg,1651.jpg,$34.95

In this sensor, the resistor is actually a small strip of Platinum with a resistance of 100 ohms at 0Â°C, thus the name PT100. Compared to most NTC/PTC thermistors, the PT type of RTD is much most stable and precise (but also more expensive) PT100's have been used for many years to measure temperature in laboratory and industrial processes, and have developed a reputation for accuracy (better than thermocouples), repeatability, and stability.Â ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3290-01.jpg,3290.jpg,$11.95

The joystick is a 'self-centering' analog-type. That means it basically acts like two 10K potentiometers, one for up/down and another for left/right. Connect one the VCC pin to your power supply (3 or 5V is best) and the ground pin to ground. Then read the two remaining pins with an analog pin each. As the joystick is moved around, the voltage will follow the motion. When you release the joystick it will center itself. There are 4 pads on the bottom, you are best off soldering 4 wires to these pins and then gluing the whole thing down.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1713,Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX9814 with Auto Gain Control,"Add an ear to your project with this well-designed electret microphone amplifier with AGC. This fully assembled and tested board comes with a 20-20KHz electret microphone soldered on. For the amplification, we use the Maxim MAX9814, a specialty chip that is designed for amplifying electret microphones in situations where the loudness of the audio isn't predictable.This fancy microphone amplifier module is a step above the rest, with built in automatic gain control. The AGC in the amplifier means that nearby 'loud' sounds will be quieted so they don't overwhelm & 'clip' the amplifier, and even quiet, far-away sounds will be amplified. This amplifier is great for when you want to record or detect audio in a setting where levels change and you don't want to have to tweak the amplifier gain all the time.The chip at the heart of this amp is the MAX9814, and has a few options you can configure with the breakout. The default 'max gain' is 60dB, but can be set to 40dB or 50dB by jumpering the Gain pin to VCC or ground. You can also change the Attack/Release ratio, from the default 1:4000 to 1:2000 or 1:500. The ouput from the amp is about 2Vpp max on a 1.25V DC bias, so it can be easily used with any Analog/Digital converter that is up to 3.3V input. If you want to pipe it into a Line Input, just use a 1-100uF blocking capacitor in series (100uF sounds best).For audio-reactive projects, we suggest using an FFT driver library (such as the one in this library) which can take the audio input and 'translate' it into frequencies. If you just need to keep track of audio levels, see our sound-level meter tutorial for ArduinoEach order comes with one assembled and tested board, with electret mic pre-soldered on, and a small piece of header. Our tutorial will get you started with using and testing the microphone amplifier and you can check out our general-purpose microphone amplifier tutorial for other project ideas and code.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1713-00.jpg,1713.jpg,$7.95

But how to keep an enclosure weather/waterproof while still attaching cables for power, data or sensors? That's where cable glands come in. By installing these over the cable, they form-fit to make a seal, keeping your project box innards safe from the outdoors.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1115,Adafruit Blue&White 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi,"This new Adafruit Pi Plate makes it easy to use a blue and white 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the 16x2 Character LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another 1 to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Pi!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.New, we've updated this Pi plate so the buttons on on the right side, which makes it a little more mechanically stableThis pi plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The plate is designed for both Revision 1 and Revision 2 Raspberry Pi's. It uses the I2C (SDA/SCL) pins. We have a special xtra-tall 26-pin header so the plate sits above the USB and Ethernet jacks. For Pi Model B+ and Pi 2, the resistors sit right above the new set of USB ports. To keep them from shorting against the metal, a piece of electrical tape must be placed onto the USB ports.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). A 16x2 Character blue&white monochrome LCD is included! Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasing You may get a 2-row or 1-row connector LCD, either will work fine.We also have some handy Python code to help you easily talk to the LCD and buttons You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the code and plate can control the white backlight on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this plate can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1115-00.jpg,1115.jpg,$19.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/727,3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST,"This battery holder connects 3 AAA batteries together in series for powering all kinds of projects. We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes them ideal for use with 3.3V projects that have a 2-pin JST connector meant for one of our Li-Ion/Poly batteries. (Of course, you can't recharge them like Li-Ion/Polys, so don't try to plug this into one of our Li-Ion/Poly charger boards!)Fits any standard AAA battery. When using rechargeable NiMH the output voltage will range from about 3.7V with charged batteries to 2.7V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of 3.6V. When using alkalines, the output will range from 4.6V with new batteries to 3.3V at the end of life with a nominal voltage of about 4.5VThe polarity matches that of our 2-pin JST cable and Li-Ion/Poly batteries.

We have a modified version of the Arduino IDE so Mac & Windows users can get started fast - or with the new 1.6.4+ Arduino IDE, it takes only a few seconds to add Flora-support. The FLORA has USB HID support, so it can act like a mouse or keyboard to attach directly to computers.FLORA has a small but easy to use onboard reset button to reboot the system. The power supply is designed to be flexible and easy to use. There is an onboard polarized 2 JST battery connector with protection schottky diode for use with external battery packs from 3.5v to 16v DC in. Can be used with LiIon/LiPoly, LiFe, alkaline or rechargeable NiMh/NiCad batteries of any size. The FLORA does not have a LiPo charger included by design, this allows safe use with multiple battery types and reduces risk of fire as it is not recommended to charge these batteries on fabric. We suggest one of our micro-lipo chargers if you want to use LiPo batteries with FLORA.FLORA has onboard power switch connected to 2A power FET for safe and efficient battery on/off control, so you can power quite a bit without burning out your switch. The FLORA has an onboard 3.3v 250mA regulator with a protection diode and USB fuse so that the microcontroller voltage is consistent and can power common 3.3v modules and sensors.We spent a lot of time on the power supply because the FLORA power system is specifically designed to allow easy control and power of a large quantity of addressable NeoPixels.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

http://www.adafruit.com/product/896,Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Green LEDs + Coin Cell Holder,"Add sparkle to your project with these lovely silver wire LED strands. These strands are very interesting, they use two silver wires that are coated so they don't short if they touch, then tiny 1000mcd LEDs are bonded onto the wires and coated with epoxy. The result is a very flexible silver wire with sparkly ""fairy"" lights that are much less visible than normal LEDs. They're still just LEDs, but in a fun new form-factor! They're even waterproof - you can dunk these or have them outdoors, just be sure to protect the battery holder.Each strand comes with 12 LEDs, approximately 5cm/2 inches apart for a 2 foot long strand of wire. At one end of the magnet wire, a double stranded-core wire is soldered on and heat-shrinked to protect it. A 2 x CR2032 coin cell holder with on/off switch is on the other side. Of course, if you want you can just cut the coin cell holder off and solder on a 3xAAA battery holder or 3xAA battery holder. To solder to the magnet wire, scrape off the coating first.Requires 2 x CR2032 batteries to run. Does not come with batteries, we do stock CR2032 batteries if you want to use them as is. Runs for about 8 hours continuously on two CR2032's.Please note: There are no series resistor installed in the strand, if you want to use another supply you will need to calculate and solder in a resistor. The reason that two 3V coin cells can be used to drive LEDs with a forward voltage of about 3.2V is that coin cells have an internal resistance that makes up for the lack of a choke resistor. If you want to drive these via a 6V power supply, you'll want to put in a 20-220 ohm (or larger) resistor in series to avoid burning out the LEDs. If you want to use a 4.5V power supply, use 10-100 ohms (or larger).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/896-00.jpg,/896.jpg,$4.95

It's there for you.By default, we've set it up so that it matches our FTDI cables. The 6th pin is RTS (as of Arduino IDE v18 this will work perfectly for uploading to 'inos), the power wire is +5V and the signal levels are 3.3V (they are 5V compliant, and should work in the vast majority of 3.3V and 5V signal systems).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/284-00.jpg,/284.jpg,$14.75

http://www.adafruit.com/product/2831,Photo Transistor Light Sensor,"This Photo Transistor Light SensorÂ is aÂ simple sensor that detects ambient light. It's kind of the opposite of an LED - when light hits the little chip inside, it induces current to flow from the long pin to the short pin. This sensor has a built-in optical filter (probably IR filter) so it'll do a fair job of simulating light levels as the human eye does.Â  Basically, connect the pin connected to the 'thicker' part of the sensor to 3-15VDC or so, and the thinner-part pin through a ~1K-10K series resistor to ground. When its dark, there's almost no current flowing through the sensor or resistor and the analog voltage is near ground. When there's light near the sensor, the current through the resistor will increase, raising the voltage. You can adjust the series resistor to get the voltage range you need, and measure the analog voltage with a microcontroller. If you're not getting any readings, try flipping the sensor around.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2831-00.jpg,2831.jpg,$0.95

Â The Resistive Touch Screen to USB Mouse Controller is a board thatÂ can handle analog to digital conversion.

The AR1100 is a nice chip that solves this problem by acting as a touch->USB converter and also comes with calibration software. The calibration software is Windows only, but once you've calibrated you can use the screen on any OS. The touch screen shows up as a USB mouse so no special drivers needed. We've tested it sucessfully on Mac, Windows, and Debian Linux (Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi). Other Linux distributions may or may not work, but if you're running Linux you're probably used to that.Â We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.This version comes in 1024x600 instead ofÂ the more expensive 1280x800 display.Â It's also not IPS so it's not good for wide-angle visibility.There's a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/757,4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - BSS138,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.We do have some other handy level shifters in the shop, from the DIP 74LVC245 to the fancy bi-directional TXB0108. However, neither of these are happy to work with I2C, which uses a funky pull-up system to transfer data back and forth. This level shifter board combines the ease-of-use of the bi-directional TXB0108 with an I2C-compatible FET design following NXP's app note.This breakout has 4 BSS138 FETs with 10K pullups. It works down to 1.8V on the low side, and up to 10V on the high side. The 10K's do make the interface a little more sluggish than using a TXB0108 or 74LVC245 so we suggest checking those out if you need high-speed transfer.While we designed it for use with I2C, this works as well forÂ  TTL Serial,Â  slow <2MHz SPI, and any other digital interface both uni-directional and bidirectional. Comes with a fully assembled, and tested PCB with 4 full bidirectional converter lines as well as 2 pieces of 6-pin header you can solder on to plug into a breadboard or perfboard.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/757-03.jpg,/757.jpg,$3.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/3846,High Temp Waterproof DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor - 3m long,"This is a pre-wired and waterproofed version of the DS18B20 sensor made with a PTFE wire cable. Handy for when you need to measure something far away, or in wet conditions. This sensor is a little more expensive than the other waterproof version we have with a PVC cable because this one can be used up to 125Â°C - the limit of the sensor itself. That said, it's still not recommended for salt-water or corrosive environments since the stainless steel will eventually rust!Because the sensor signal is digital, you don't get any signal degradation even over long distances! These 1-wire digital temperature sensors are fairly precise (Â±0.5Â°C over much of the range) and can give up to 12 bits of precision from the onboard digital-to-analog converter. They work great with any microcontroller using a single digital pin, and you can even connect multiple ones to the same pin, each one has a unique 64-bit ID burned in at the factory to differentiate them. Usable with 3.0-5.0V systems.The only downside is they use the Dallas 1-Wire protocol, which is somewhat complex, and requires a bunch of code to parse out the communication. If you want something really simple, and you have an analog input pin, the TMP36 is trivial to get going.You'll need a 4.7k resistor which is required as a pullup from the DATA to VCC line when using the sensor. Here's a CircuitPython/Python guide for these sensors. We don't have a detailed Arduino tutorial, but you can get started by using the Dallas Temperature Control Arduino library which requires also the OneWire Library.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3846-02.jpg,3846.jpg,$21.95

However, neither of these are happy to work with I2C, which uses a funky pull-up system to transfer data back and forth. This level shifter board combines the ease-of-use of the bi-directional TXB0108 with an I2C-compatible FET design following NXP's app note.This breakout has 4 BSS138 FETs with 10K pullups. It works down to 1.8V on the low side, and up to 10V on the high side. The 10K's do make the interface a little more sluggish than using a TXB0108 or 74LVC245 so we suggest checking those out if you need high-speed transfer.While we designed it for use with I2C, this works as well forÂ  TTL Serial,Â  slow <2MHz SPI, and any other digital interface both uni-directional and bidirectional.

The chip is held securely against gold 'fingers' in the socket. 200mil or wider chips will not fit, but we do have other sockets for medium/wide SOIC chips.

The socket is soldered onto a pair of PCBs that turn it into, essentially, a 16 pin DIP with 0.6"" spacing that can be breadboarded fairly easily. Since the socket is a 16 pin socket that has been sectioned off to be only 8 pin, there are 16 pins in the breadboard, simply use 4 on each side and ignore the other 8 pins - they do provide mechanical stability when plugged into a breadboard

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1727,Thermocouple Amplifier with 1-Wire Breakout Board - MAX31850K,"Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a cold-compensation reference. So far we've carried the very nice MAX31855 which is an SPI interface thermocouple amplifier. The '855 is great but if you have a lot of thermocouples to measure it isn't terribly easy to use. That's why we are also carrying the new '850 model from Maxim - it's a ""1-Wire"" thermocouple amp which can have any number of breakouts on a single shared I/O line.The MAX31850K does everything for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller that has 1-Wire support. This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator with 10uF bypass capacitors all assembled and tested. This board can be used with 'parasitic power' - where the power is on the data line - or with 'local power' where the power for the converter comes in on the Vin Pin.Please note: this board does not have level shifting on the 3V Data line - we did this on purpose so that it can be used in parasitic mode. The data line must be level shifted to 3V - our 4-channel shifter works wonderfully for level shifting 1-Wire and you only need one at the '1-Wire host' for all thermocouples on the shared data line.The MAX31850K data format is very similar to that of the well known 1-Wire DS18B20 temp sensor but it is not drop in compatible without code changes to check for the new '1 Wire family' type. We have adapted the classic Arduino OneWire and DallasTemp libraries to be MAX31850 compatible, so please click on those links to grab our libraries.Comes with a 2 pin terminal block (for connecting to the thermocouple), 4.7K data line pullup resistor, and pin header (to plug into any breadboard or perfboard). Goes great with our 1m K-type thermocouple. Not for use with any other kind of thermocouple, K type only!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1727-00.jpg,1727.jpg,$14.95

While this is a bit longer than we are used to, we have found that the bits work quite well and are low cost enough to replace if they break.

http://www.adafruit.com/products/801,Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate Kit for Raspberry Pi,"We added lots of basic but essential goodies. First up, there's a big prototyping area, half of which is 'breadboard' style and half of which is 'perfboard' style so you can wire up DIP chips, sensors, and the like. Along the edges of the proto area, all the GPIO/I2C/SPI and power pins are broken out to 0.1"" stips so you can easily connect to them. On the edges of the prototyping area, (almost all of) the breakout pins are also connected to labeled 3.5mm screw-terminal blocks. This makes it easy to semi-permanently wire in sensors, LEDs, etc. There's also a 4-block terminal block broken out to 0.1"" pads for general non-GPIO wiring. Finally, we had a little space remaining over the metal connectors so we put in an SOIC surface mount chip breakout area, for those chips that dont come in DIP format.This kit comes as a set of parts, a little soldering is required to put it together but its really easy, even a beginner can do it in 15-20 minutes or so. The Pi (and our kits) are meant to help us all learn skills, soldering is fun! Check out our tutorial for how to assembleThe nice thing about this plate is we're getting custom header breakouts that are taller than usual, so that the proto plate sits above the metal connectors, out of the way and allows for plenty of workspace. It fits in our Pi Box enclosure with access to the terminal blocks so you can keep the Pi safe while prototyping. We'll have stackable header kits as well for those who want to put multiple plates on top.For more information, including some usage ideas check out our Proto Pi Plate tutorial",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/801-08.jpg,/801.jpg,$15.95
http://adafruit.com/product/1026,Gus the Green LED - Circuit Playground Plushie,"Gus is the smartest member of the group, but also the most coarse. Gus is the closest thing to an engineer in the group: he is pragmatic, realistic and somewhat world-weary, but not a total downer. He will sometimes cut people off mid-sentence because he is impatient, not because he's trying to be mean or rude. Gus will occasionally make pithy observations that shed light on some problem or other. He is sort of an older brother to Ruby. Gus speaks in a New York / New Jersey accent. He often says things like ""that ain't gonna work"" or ""maybe we should do somethin' else."" His catchphrase is ""don't go nuts,"" typically in response to some suggested crazy scheme, though he is usually ignored.About LEDs: LEDs are two-terminal electronic devices, and are a special type of diode. The first modern LEDs were created by engineer Nick Holonyak in 1962 at General Electric. When electrons cross part of the diffusion region of a diode (an area called the band gap), a photon is emitted. The size of the band gap determines the wavelength (color) of the photon. LEDs are available in many wavelengths ranging from infrared to ultraviolet.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1026-07.jpg,1026.jpg,$9.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/2959,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 60 LED/m - WHITE,"There are 60 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 0.66""/17mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 4 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 4 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 4m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

http://adafruit.com/product/519,Conductive Rubber Cord Stretch Sensor + extras!,"Measuring stretch forces isn't easy - unless you have some conductive rubber cord! This cord is 2mm diameter, and 1 meter long, made of carbon-black impregnated rubber. Usually this material is used for EMF gasketing, but its also very fun to play with.In a 'relaxed' state, the resistance is about 350 ohms per inch. As you pull on it, the resistance increases (the particles get further apart). As you stretch it out, the resistance increases. So lets say you have a 6"" piece - thats about 2.1 Kohms. Stretch it to 10"" long and now it is 10""/6""*2.1K = 3.5 Kohms. You can stretch the rubber about 50-70% longer than the resting length, so a 6"" piece shouldn't be stretched more than 10"". Once the force is released, the rubber will shrink back, although its not very 'fast' and it takes a minute or two to revert to its original length. It's not a true linear sensor, and the resistance may vary from batch to batch, so we consider it a way to measure stretching motion but isn't really precise.This stuff is fun, so we give you a full meter and also two alligator clips (to connect to the cord) and a 10K resistor. Together, you can use these to make a simple voltage divider. Then use our handy Thermistor tutorial to measure the analog voltage and convert that back to resistance.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/519-03.jpg,/519.jpg,$9.95

http://adafruit.com/product/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

It has a built in LED that can be controlled separately from the switch action - either to indicate or just to look good.The body is a black plastic with the LED built inside. There are two contacts for the button and two contacts for the LED, one marked + and one -. The forward voltage of the LED is about 3V so connect a 220 to 1000 ohm resistor in series just as you would with any other LED to your 3V or higher power supply.This particular button has a blue body and LED and is momentary, normally open. The two switch contacts are not connected normally. When you push the button they will temporarily connect until the button is released. The LED is separated from the button, so you can make it light up when pressed, light up when not pressed, always lit, etc.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1477-00.jpg,1477.jpg,$1.95

The pixels are chainable - so you only need 1 pin/wire to control as many LEDs as you like.These pixels have full 24-bit color ability with PWM taken care of by the controller chip. Since the LED is so bright, you need less current/power to get the effects you want. The driver is constant current so it's OK if your battery power changes or fluctuates a little.Each pixel draws as much as 60mA (all three RGB LEDs on for full brightness white). An Arduino can drive up to 500 pixels at 30 FPS (it will run out of RAM after that). Using ribbon cable you can string these up to 6"" apart (after that, you might get power droops and data corruption)Each order comes with 50 individually controllable pixel buttons.

The joystick is a 'self-centering' analog-type. That means it basically acts like two 10K potentiometers, one for up/down and another for left/right. Connect one the VCC pin to your power supply (3 or 5V is best) and the ground pin to ground. Then read the two remaining pins with an analog pin each. As the joystick is moved around, the voltage will follow the motion. When you release the joystick it will center itself.

Thanks to the Doctor, you will now be able to watch and care for your USB-powered projects.

Use the USB Charger Doctor to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.05 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. The Doctor's digital display instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones.

You can use this device from 3.5-7VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. It flips between voltage and current readouts every 3 seconds or so. It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator.

These little PCBs are only 9.1mm x 9.1mm and have two sets of three pads on the back for soldering wires. These ultra-bright LEDs have a constant-current driver cooked right into the LED package! The pixels are chainable - so you only need 1 pin/wire to control as many LEDs as you like.These pixels have full 24-bit color ability with PWM taken care of by the controller chip. Since the LED is so bright, you need less current/power to get the effects you want. The driver is constant current so it's OK if your battery power changes or fluctuates a little.Each pixel draws as much as 60mA (all three RGB LEDs on for full brightness white). An Arduino can drive up to 500 pixels at 30 FPS (it will run out of RAM after that). Using ribbon cable you can string these up to 6"" apart (after that, you might get power droops and data corruption)Each order comes with 50 individually controllable pixel buttons. We also carry a 5-pack if you don't need 50.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

Hardware SPI support is handy but not required. This makes them excellent for use with any microcontroller or microprocessor, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Propeller, SparkCore, and any 'raw' microcontrollers/microprocessors.

Its covered in what seems to be PVC, the tape is thus weather-proof - but note that the connectors are NOT waterproof, just a bit of heatshrink. This isn't something we would suggest leaving outdoors for extended periods.

Because EL tape has more surface area than wire, it requires a more powerful inverter for the same length. This tape is about 4 times more capacitive (per length) than our high-brightness EL wire and 8 times more capacitive than 'standard' EL wire. For that reason, we are shipping the EL tape in 100cm lengths with two EL connectors soldered on, one on each end. You can cut it into two pieces of any length and use both halves!

Note that the maximum amount for the 2xAA pocket inverter we carry is 60cm so don't try to run the full strip off of one inverter - it will look dim and isnt nice to the inverter - cut it in half first! Plug it in and it will light up nicely! A 50cm strip draws about 200mA from the 2xAA batteries in the pocket inverter (so 2000mAh batteries will last ~10 hours if on 'constant' mode). You can also use our 4xAAA inverter which is strong enough to power a full meter at once - plug in only one end of the tape to the inverter or cut it in half and plug both halves in.

Please note! EL tape, EL wire and EL panel are made with different processes and so the color and brightness will not be consistant between the two: aqua tape, aqua wire and aqua panels will not necessarily match!

http://adafruit.com/product/1790,"Adafruit ""Music Maker"" MP3 Shield for Arduino (MP3/Ogg/WAV...)","Bend all audio files to your will with the Adafruit Music Maker shield for Arduino! This powerful shield features the VS1053, an encoding/decoding (codec) chip that can decode a wide variety of audio formats such as MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, WMA, MIDI, FLAC, WAV (PCM and ADPCM). It can also be used to record audio in both PCM (WAV) and compressed Ogg Vorbis. You can do all sorts of stuff with the audio as well such as adjusting bass, treble, and volume digitally.All this functionality is implemented in a light-weight SPI interface so that any Arduino can play audio from an SD card. There's also a special MIDI mode that you can boot the chip into that will read 'classic' 31250Kbaud MIDI data from an Arduino pin and act like a synth/drum machine - there are dozens of built-in drum and sample effects! But the chip is a pain to solder, and needs a lot of extras. That's why we spun up the best shield, perfect for use with any Arduino Uno, Leonardo or Mega.This version of the shield only has stereo line/headphone output. We also have a version with a 3W/channel class-D stereo speaker amplifier for easy use in projects that need to be loudWe believe this is the best MP3 playing shield you can get, and at a great price too.

PowerÂ the anode at 3-6V and light up the red, green, and blue LEDs by pulling their designated contacts to ground as you desire â€“Â there's a built in resistor! If you want to use this with a higher voltage, say 12V or 24V, simply add a 1K ohm resistor in series with the LED cathodes to keep the LED current at around 20mA. You can PWM the RGB pins to make any color you like.This button is a momentary push button, when you press it the 'normally-open' contact shorts to the common contact. When you release it, the contacts open up again.The switch and LED are electrically separated, so to change the color, use a microcontroller to both read the contact pins and toggle the color control pins.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-videos/1024x768/3350-03.jpg,3350.jpg,$10.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/415,Aqua Electroluminescent (EL) Tape Strip - 100cm w/two connectors,"EL tape is the big sister to EL wire - it has the same glow effect but with a flat, wide shape instead of a round shape. The glowing part of the tape is 1 cm wide (the plastic coating is about 1.5cm wide). The other side has an adhesive on it so you can stick the tape onto something. Its covered in what seems to be PVC, the tape is thus weather-proof - but note that the connectors are NOT waterproof, just a bit of heatshrink. This isn't something we would suggest leaving outdoors for extended periods.

Because EL tape has more surface area than wire, it requires a more powerful inverter for the same length. This tape is about 4 times more capacitive (per length) than our high-brightness EL wire and 8 times more capacitive than 'standard' EL wire. For that reason, we are shipping the EL tape in 100cm lengths with two EL connectors soldered on, one on each end. You can cut it into two pieces of any length and use both halves!

Note that the maximum amount for the 2xAA pocket inverter we carry is 60cm so don't try to run the full strip off of one inverter - it will look dim and isnt nice to the inverter - cut it in half first! Plug it in and it will light up nicely! A 50cm strip draws about 200mA from the 2xAA batteries in the pocket inverter (so 2000mAh batteries will last ~10 hours if on 'constant' mode). You can also use our 4xAAA inverter which is strong enough to power a full meter at once - plug in only one end of the tape to the inverter or cut it in half and plug both halves in.

Please note! EL tape, EL wire and EL panel are made with different processes and so the color and brightness will not be consistant between the two: aqua tape, aqua wire and aqua panels will not necessarily match!

We like this one because the legs are 0.2"" apart with pin-points, so you can plug it into a breadboard or perfboard. Once you're done prototyping, you can drill a hole into your project box and mount the potentiometer that way.

Connect 3 to 6V to the LED to have it light up nicely, there's a built in resistor! If you want to use this with a higher voltage, say 12V or 24V, simply add a 470 ohm resistor in series with the LED connection to keep the LED current at around 20mA.This button is an on/off switch button, when you press it the 'normally-open' contact shorts to the common contact and the button stays 'pressed'. When you press it a second time, the button springs open, and the contacts open up again.The switch and LED are separated, so you could wire it to turn on when pressed or vice versa or whatever you wish!

Is there a doctor in the house? Oh, thank goodness, the Charger Doctor is here! Right on time...Doctor, can you tell us what the current draw is? What about the voltage? Thanks to the Doctor, you will now be able to watch and care for your USB-powered projects.

Use the USB Charger Doctor to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.05 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. The Doctor's digital display instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones.

You can use this device from 3.5-7VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. It flips between voltage and current readouts every 3 seconds or so. It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator.

This powerful shield features the VS1053, an encoding/decoding (codec) chip that can decode a wide variety of audio formats such as MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, WMA, MIDI, FLAC, WAV (PCM and ADPCM). It can also be used to record audio in both PCM (WAV) and compressed Ogg Vorbis. You can do all sorts of stuff with the audio as well such as adjusting bass, treble, and volume digitally.All this functionality is implemented in a light-weight SPI interface so that any Arduino can play audio from an SD card. There's also a special MIDI mode that you can boot the chip into that will read 'classic' 31250Kbaud MIDI data from an Arduino pin and act like a synth/drum machine - there are dozens of built-in drum and sample effects! But the chip is a pain to solder, and needs a lot of extras. That's why we spun up the best shield, perfect for use with any Arduino Uno, Leonardo or Mega.This version of the shield only has stereo line/headphone output. We also have a version with a 3W/channel class-D stereo speaker amplifier for easy use in projects that need to be loudWe believe this is the best MP3 playing shield you can get, and at a great price too.

https://www.adafruit.com/products/1480,"2.2"" 18-bit color TFT LCD display with microSD card breakout","This lovely little display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!The 2.2"" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340 or compatible) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades!). And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller! Wiring is easy, we strongly encourage using the hardware SPI pins of your Arduino as software SPI is noticeably slower when dealing with this size display.

http://adafruit.com/product/415,Aqua Electroluminescent (EL) Tape Strip - 100cm w/two connectors,"EL tape is the big sister to EL wire - it has the same glow effect but with a flat, wide shape instead of a round shape. The glowing part of the tape is 1 cm wide (the plastic coating is about 1.5cm wide). The other side has an adhesive on it so you can stick the tape onto something. Its covered in what seems to be PVC, the tape is thus weather-proof - but note that the connectors are NOT waterproof, just a bit of heatshrink. This isn't something we would suggest leaving outdoors for extended periods.

Because EL tape has more surface area than wire, it requires a more powerful inverter for the same length. This tape is about 4 times more capacitive (per length) than our high-brightness EL wire and 8 times more capacitive than 'standard' EL wire. For that reason, we are shipping the EL tape in 100cm lengths with two EL connectors soldered on, one on each end. You can cut it into two pieces of any length and use both halves!

Note that the maximum amount for the 2xAA pocket inverter we carry is 60cm so don't try to run the full strip off of one inverter - it will look dim and isnt nice to the inverter - cut it in half first! Plug it in and it will light up nicely! A 50cm strip draws about 200mA from the 2xAA batteries in the pocket inverter (so 2000mAh batteries will last ~10 hours if on 'constant' mode). You can also use our 4xAAA inverter which is strong enough to power a full meter at once - plug in only one end of the tape to the inverter or cut it in half and plug both halves in.

Please note! EL tape, EL wire and EL panel are made with different processes and so the color and brightness will not be consistant between the two: aqua tape, aqua wire and aqua panels will not necessarily match!

However, neither of these are happy to work with I2C, which uses a funky pull-up system to transfer data back and forth.

It works down to 1.8V on the low side, and up to 10V on the high side. The 10K's do make the interface a little more sluggish than using a TXB0108 or 74LVC245 so we suggest checking those out if you need high-speed transfer.While we designed it for use with I2C, this works as well forÂ  TTL Serial,Â  slow <2MHz SPI, and any other digital interface both uni-directional and bidirectional.

http://adafruit.com/product/1115,Adafruit Blue&White 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi,"This new Adafruit Pi Plate makes it easy to use a blue and white 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the 16x2 Character LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another 1 to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Pi!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.New, we've updated this Pi plate so the buttons on on the right side, which makes it a little more mechanically stableThis pi plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The plate is designed for both Revision 1 and Revision 2 Raspberry Pi's. It uses the I2C (SDA/SCL) pins. We have a special xtra-tall 26-pin header so the plate sits above the USB and Ethernet jacks. For Pi Model B+ and Pi 2, the resistors sit right above the new set of USB ports. To keep them from shorting against the metal, a piece of electrical tape must be placed onto the USB ports.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). A 16x2 Character blue&white monochrome LCD is included! Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasing You may get a 2-row or 1-row connector LCD, either will work fine.We also have some handy Python code to help you easily talk to the LCD and buttons You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the code and plate can control the white backlight on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this plate can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1115-00.jpg,1115.jpg,$19.95

http://adafruit.com/product/416,White Electroluminescent (EL) Tape Strip -100cm w/two connectors,"EL tape is the big sister to EL wire - it has the same glow effect but with a flat, wide shape instead of a round shape. The glowing part of the tape is 1 cm wide (the plastic coating is about 1.5cm wide). The other side has an adhesive on it so you can stick the tape onto something. Its covered in what seems to be PVC, the tape is thus weather-proof - but note that the connectors are NOT waterproof, just a bit of heatshrink. This isn't something we would suggest leaving outdoors for extended periods.

Because EL tape has more surface area than wire, it requires a more powerful inverter for the same length. This tape is about 4 times more capacitive (per length) than our high-brightness EL wire and 8 times more capacitive than 'standard' EL wire. For that reason, we are shipping the EL tape in 100cm lengths with two EL connectors soldered on, one on each end. You can cut it into two pieces of any length and use both halves!

Note that the maximum amount for the 2xAA pocket inverter we carry is 60cm so don't try to run the full strip off of one inverter - it will look dim and isnt nice to the inverter - cut it in half first! Plug it in and it will light up nicely! A 50cm strip draws about 200mA from the 2xAA batteries in the pocket inverter (so 2000mAh batteries will last ~10 hours if on 'constant' mode). You can also use our 4xAAA inverter which is strong enough to power a full meter at once - plug in only one end of the tape to the inverter or cut it in half and plug both halves in.

Please note! EL tape, EL wire and EL panel are made with different processes and so the color and brightness will not be consistant between the two: white tape, white wire and white panels will not necessarily match!

Is there a doctor in the house? Oh, thank goodness, the Charger Doctor is here! Right on time...Doctor, can you tell us what the current draw is? What about the voltage? Thanks to the Doctor, you will now be able to watch and care for your USB-powered projects.

Use the USB Charger Doctor to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.05 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. The Doctor's digital display instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones.

You can use this device from 3.5-7VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. It flips between voltage and current readouts every 3 seconds or so. It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator.

Without an extra heatsink, you can burn off up to 0.6W.Â Â We like this calculator for determining your heat sink requirementsÂ It's a TO-92 package, so use 200Â°C/Watt junction-to-air thermal resistance. The wattage of your set up is = (InputVoltageÂ - 3.3V) *Â AverageCurrentInAmps. E.g. a 9V battery and 0.2 Amp of average output current means the regulator is burning off (9 - 3.3)*0.2 = 1.14 Watts! That's way too much for the little package, it will overheat. Instead, reduce your average current to 0.1A (for 0.57W) or you could use a 5V power supply for (5-3.3)*0.2 = 0.34W, both of which would not require a heatsink.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2166-00.jpg,2166.jpg,$0.95

It's there for you.By default, we've set it up so that it matches our FTDI cables. The 6th pin is RTS (as of Arduino IDE v18 this will work perfectly for uploading to 'inos), the power wire is +5V and the signal levels are 3.3V (they are 5V compliant, and should work in the vast majority of 3.3V and 5V signal systems).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/284-00.jpg,/284.jpg,$14.75

This is the stuff used to make flexible circuits, but raw and unetched. You can treat it just like 1 oz copper clad, etch it with ferric chloride (or other PCB etching systems) or cut with scissors. It may even be possible to laser or CNC engrave (we haven't tried it ourselves but we'd love to hear about it if you get any results.)Pyralux is the brand name of Dupont's flex PCB material that's used in cell phones and other small circuits. One side of it's 1 oz copper while the other side is polyamide for strength and flexibility. The material can be manipulated through and around small areas and won't crack as easily as copper tape. Pyralux is used in a ton of consumer-grade electronics and one of the reasons why things like your cell phones have advanced from bulky and cumbersome to miniature super computers.Comes with a 6""x6"" (152mm x 152mm) square of Pyralux. It's ED-Y type copper at 35um (1 oz/ft2) and has a polymide of 25um (1 mil). The thick copper layer means it can carry a lot of current, and its trivial to solder to it. We have a little demo of it with a 1W LED above.All of this makes Pyralux yet another great material for your next wearables project or whatever project you come up with!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1894-01.jpg,1894.jpg,$9.95

http://www.adafruit.com/products/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1429,Adafruit 24-Channel 12-bit PWM LED Driver - SPI Interface - TLC5947,"For all of you out there who want to control 24 channels of PWM, we salute you! We also would like you to check out this breakout board for the TLC5947 PWM driver chip. This chip can control 24 separate channels of 12-bit PWM output. Designed (and ideal) for LED control, this board is not good for driving servos. If you need to drive servos, we have a controller for that over here.Only three ""SPI"" pins are required to send data (our Arduino library shows how to to use any digital microcontroller pins). Best of all, the design is completely chainable. As long as there's enough power for all the boards you can chain as many as you'd like, like a little trail of blue PCBs stretching out into the sunset. Each of the 24 output's is constant-current and open drain. You can drive multiple LEDs in series, with a V+ anode supply of up to 30V. If you want to drive something that requires a digital input, you must use a pullup resistor from the drive pin to your logic level to create the full waveform.One resistor is used to set the current for each of the outputs, the constant current means that the LED brightness doesn't vary if the power supply dips. We use a 3.3K resistor for about 15mA but you can solder a thru-hole resistor over it if you'd like to change that value. Check the TLC5947 datasheet for details on resistor-to-current values.We include a few extras to make this board easy to use: a durable 5V low-dropout regulator (with reverse polarity protection in case y'know, you plug it in backwards), a green power-good LED, four mounting holes and a current-set resistor. A bit of 0.1"" header is also included so you can solder it on and plug into a breadboard.To use: Power V+ with 5-30VDC, and connect ground to the common ground. Then send 3-5V logic SPI data on DIN (data in), CLK (clock) and LAT (latch). If you'd like to quickly turn off all the outputs, raise the OE pin - it's pulled low to enable the PWM outputs.Our Arduino library will get you started with blinking LEDs, install it and run the example code with the noted pin configuration.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1429-00.jpg,1429.jpg,$14.95

We have a modified version of the Arduino IDE so Mac & Windows users can get started fast - or with the new 1.6.4+ Arduino IDE, it takes only a few seconds to add Flora-support. The FLORA has USB HID support, so it can act like a mouse or keyboard to attach directly to computers.FLORA has a small but easy to use onboard reset button to reboot the system. The power supply is designed to be flexible and easy to use. There is an onboard polarized 2 JST battery connector with protection schottky diode for use with external battery packs from 3.5v to 16v DC in. Can be used with LiIon/LiPoly, LiFe, alkaline or rechargeable NiMh/NiCad batteries of any size. The FLORA does not have a LiPo charger included by design, this allows safe use with multiple battery types and reduces risk of fire as it is not recommended to charge these batteries on fabric. We suggest one of our micro-lipo chargers if you want to use LiPo batteries with FLORA.FLORA has onboard power switch connected to 2A power FET for safe and efficient battery on/off control, so you can power quite a bit without burning out your switch. The FLORA has an onboard 3.3v 250mA regulator with a protection diode and USB fuse so that the microcontroller voltage is consistent and can power common 3.3v modules and sensors.We spent a lot of time on the power supply because the FLORA power system is specifically designed to allow easy control and power of a large quantity of addressable NeoPixels. Flora can easily drive 50 pixels directly from the onboard power supply, or up to 500 with the pixels externally powered by a separate 5V supply.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/659-07.jpg,/659.jpg,$14.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/801,Adafruit Prototyping Pi Plate Kit for Raspberry Pi,"We added lots of basic but essential goodies. First up, there's a big prototyping area, half of which is 'breadboard' style and half of which is 'perfboard' style so you can wire up DIP chips, sensors, and the like. Along the edges of the proto area, all the GPIO/I2C/SPI and power pins are broken out to 0.1"" stips so you can easily connect to them. On the edges of the prototyping area, (almost all of) the breakout pins are also connected to labeled 3.5mm screw-terminal blocks. This makes it easy to semi-permanently wire in sensors, LEDs, etc. There's also a 4-block terminal block broken out to 0.1"" pads for general non-GPIO wiring. Finally, we had a little space remaining over the metal connectors so we put in an SOIC surface mount chip breakout area, for those chips that dont come in DIP format.This kit comes as a set of parts, a little soldering is required to put it together but its really easy, even a beginner can do it in 15-20 minutes or so. The Pi (and our kits) are meant to help us all learn skills, soldering is fun! Check out our tutorial for how to assembleThe nice thing about this plate is we're getting custom header breakouts that are taller than usual, so that the proto plate sits above the metal connectors, out of the way and allows for plenty of workspace. It fits in our Pi Box enclosure with access to the terminal blocks so you can keep the Pi safe while prototyping. We'll have stackable header kits as well for those who want to put multiple plates on top.For more information, including some usage ideas check out our Proto Pi Plate tutorial",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/801-08.jpg,/801.jpg,$15.95

They're not waterproof or weatherproof, so best used indoors.This button has a flat green plastic cover with a black retaining ring around it. There's an optional LED included that will light up the button. The LED has a built in resistor so you can run it up to 12V but given the shallow depth of the button, it doesn't illuminate the entire button face evenly.

https://www.adafruit.com/products/1785,Medium Surface Transducer with Wires - 4 Ohm 3 Watt,"Turn any surface/wall/table etc into a speaker with a surface transducer. This type of speaker does not have a moving cone like most speakers you've seen. Instead, a small metal rod is wrapped with the voice coil. When current is pulsed through the coil, the magnetic field causes a piece of metal to expand and contract - and if it's pressed against a surface it turns the transducer into a speaker!Often these size transducers are pressed up against a flat surface to turn it into a sounding board. The effect is a surprisingly clear sound that comes from the surface itself. The body of the transducer is heavy so that it can be placed with theÂ top down on a table. And for another fun trick, put the transducer at the end of a large plastic cup to point sound in a particular direction.This transducer is about 28mm in diameter and has 4Î© impedence and should be run at about 3W. It pairs great with any of our audio amps such as the TS2012 breakout or MAX98306.

http://www.adafruit.com/products/1667,"7"" Display 1280x800 (720p) IPS + Speakers - HDMI/VGA/NTSC/PAL","Yes, this is an adorable small HDMI television with incredibly high resolution and built in 3W stereo speakers! We tried to get the smallest possible HDMI/VGA display with high-res, high-contrast visibility. The visible display measures only 7"" (17.8cm) diagonal, and the TFT comes in an enclosure with HDMI, VGA and Composite inputs. The display is very easy to use - simply connect a 9 to 12VDC adapter to the 2.1mm center-positive DC jack (not included) then connect a digital video source to one of the ports. Voila, a television display!

There's some little buttons on the front that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It auto-detects which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu which to display. It comes with a basic stand (shown) and there are four 'mounting thread' holes in the back in a 75mmx75mm square and you can use M4 screws to attach it to an enclosure. There's also a ""Camera Mount"" 1/4-20 hole in the bottom so you can attach it to a camera-ready mount.

To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI, VGA or NTSC/PAL output. It will not work with a device that only outputs DVI (without a DVI to HDMI adapter) or SECAM.

There's also a slot in the side for a USB stick. In theory if you put some MP3's , pictures or videos on the stick and plug it in you can use the display as a viewer (but we haven't tried it). There'a also an audio line-in 3.5mm jack, so if you want to use VGA you can pipe in audio from an external source. It doesn't work with NTSC input though! The + and - buttons on the front allow you to quickly change the speaker volume. Its not a HiFi but its fairly loud and good for movies & games.

Works great with a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black, as well as our XBox, Windows desktop and Macbook (with an HDMI adapter cable). Some OS's such as Windows may require you to set the audio output to the external display but with the XBox & RasPi it immediately used the speakers without any poking or prodding.

A power adapter is not included. Any 9 to 12VDC adapter will work nicely: we prefer 9V DC. Video will work with 5-12V but the audio amplifier requires 9-12V so if you want the speakers to work, 9V is best. Check the technical tabs for current draw at various voltages.

You can set the brightness of each R/G/B. Each LED acts like a shift register, reading incoming data on the input pins, and then shifting the previous data out on the output pin. By sending a long string of data, you can control an infinite number of LEDs, just tack on more or disconnect unwanted LEDs at the end. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the brightness you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for you.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3630-02.jpg,3630.jpg,$27.50

Â Just like the charger doctor, you can use this meter to find out if your voltage is too low or your current draw is too high.

Use the USB In-Line Voltage and Current Meter to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.025 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. This voltage meter has anÂ OLED display that shows off voltage, watts, amps, and mAH and instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones. Â There's a button on the back that allows you to flip the display 180Â° for easier reading.

You can use this device from 3.7-13VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. Â It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices above 7VDC, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1667,"7"" Display 1280x800 (720p) IPS + Speakers - HDMI/VGA/NTSC/PAL","Yes, this is an adorable small HDMI television with incredibly high resolution and built in 3W stereo speakers! We tried to get the smallest possible HDMI/VGA display with high-res, high-contrast visibility. The visible display measures only 7"" (17.8cm) diagonal, and the TFT comes in an enclosure with HDMI, VGA and Composite inputs. The display is very easy to use - simply connect a 9 to 12VDC adapter to the 2.1mm center-positive DC jack (not included) then connect a digital video source to one of the ports. Voila, a television display!

There's some little buttons on the front that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It auto-detects which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu which to display. It comes with a basic stand (shown) and there are four 'mounting thread' holes in the back in a 75mmx75mm square and you can use M4 screws to attach it to an enclosure. There's also a ""Camera Mount"" 1/4-20 hole in the bottom so you can attach it to a camera-ready mount.

To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI, VGA or NTSC/PAL output. It will not work with a device that only outputs DVI (without a DVI to HDMI adapter) or SECAM.

There's also a slot in the side for a USB stick. In theory if you put some MP3's , pictures or videos on the stick and plug it in you can use the display as a viewer (but we haven't tried it). There'a also an audio line-in 3.5mm jack, so if you want to use VGA you can pipe in audio from an external source. It doesn't work with NTSC input though! The + and - buttons on the front allow you to quickly change the speaker volume. Its not a HiFi but its fairly loud and good for movies & games.

Works great with a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black, as well as our XBox, Windows desktop and Macbook (with an HDMI adapter cable). Some OS's such as Windows may require you to set the audio output to the external display but with the XBox & RasPi it immediately used the speakers without any poking or prodding.

A power adapter is not included. Any 9 to 12VDC adapter will work nicely: we prefer 9V DC. Video will work with 5-12V but the audio amplifier requires 9-12V so if you want the speakers to work, 9V is best. Check the technical tabs for current draw at various voltages.

Usable with 3.0-5.0V systems.The only downside is they use the Dallas 1-Wire protocol, which is somewhat complex, and requires a bunch of code to parse out the communication. There's a great Arduino library for 1-Wire, but some microcontrollers do not have support for 1-Wire so be sure to check!We toss in a 4.7k resistor, which is required as a pullup from the DATA to VCC line when using the sensor.

This makes the solenoid able to pull from one end, or push from the other.This solenoid in particular is chunkier than our little 5V one, with a 27mm long body, 10mm long throw, and a 'captive' armature with a return spring. This means that when activated with up to 6VDC, the solenoid moves and then the voltage is removed, it springs back to the original position, which is quite handy. Many lower cost solenoids are only push type or only pull type and may not have a captive armature (it'll fall out!) or don't have a return spring.Â ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3992-01.jpg,3992.jpg,$7.50

This is the stuff used to make flexible circuits, but raw and unetched. You can treat it just like 1 oz copper clad, etch it with ferric chloride (or other PCB etching systems) or cut with scissors. It may even be possible to laser or CNC engrave (we haven't tried it ourselves but we'd love to hear about it if you get any results.)Pyralux is the brand name of Dupont's flex PCB material that's used in cell phones and other small circuits. One side of it's 1 oz copper while the other side is polyamide for strength and flexibility. The material can be manipulated through and around small areas and won't crack as easily as copper tape. Pyralux is used in a ton of consumer-grade electronics and one of the reasons why things like your cell phones have advanced from bulky and cumbersome to miniature super computers.Comes with a 6""x6"" (152mm x 152mm) square of Pyralux. It's ED-Y type copper at 35um (1 oz/ft2) and has a polymide of 25um (1 mil). The thick copper layer means it can carry a lot of current, and its trivial to solder to it. We have a little demo of it with a 1W LED above.All of this makes Pyralux yet another great material for your next wearables project or whatever project you come up with!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1894-01.jpg,1894.jpg,$9.95

https://www.adafruit.com/products/1713,Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX9814 with Auto Gain Control,"Add an ear to your project with this well-designed electret microphone amplifier with AGC. This fully assembled and tested board comes with a 20-20KHz electret microphone soldered on. For the amplification, we use the Maxim MAX9814, a specialty chip that is designed for amplifying electret microphones in situations where the loudness of the audio isn't predictable.This fancy microphone amplifier module is a step above the rest, with built in automatic gain control. The AGC in the amplifier means that nearby 'loud' sounds will be quieted so they don't overwhelm & 'clip' the amplifier, and even quiet, far-away sounds will be amplified. This amplifier is great for when you want to record or detect audio in a setting where levels change and you don't want to have to tweak the amplifier gain all the time.The chip at the heart of this amp is the MAX9814, and has a few options you can configure with the breakout. The default 'max gain' is 60dB, but can be set to 40dB or 50dB by jumpering the Gain pin to VCC or ground. You can also change the Attack/Release ratio, from the default 1:4000 to 1:2000 or 1:500. The ouput from the amp is about 2Vpp max on a 1.25V DC bias, so it can be easily used with any Analog/Digital converter that is up to 3.3V input. If you want to pipe it into a Line Input, just use a 1-100uF blocking capacitor in series (100uF sounds best).For audio-reactive projects, we suggest using an FFT driver library (such as the one in this library) which can take the audio input and 'translate' it into frequencies. If you just need to keep track of audio levels, see our sound-level meter tutorial for ArduinoEach order comes with one assembled and tested board, with electret mic pre-soldered on, and a small piece of header. Our tutorial will get you started with using and testing the microphone amplifier and you can check out our general-purpose microphone amplifier tutorial for other project ideas and code.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1713-00.jpg,1713.jpg,$7.95

https://adafruit.com/product/1785,Medium Surface Transducer with Wires - 4 Ohm 3 Watt,"Turn any surface/wall/table etc into a speaker with a surface transducer. This type of speaker does not have a moving cone like most speakers you've seen. Instead, a small metal rod is wrapped with the voice coil. When current is pulsed through the coil, the magnetic field causes a piece of metal to expand and contract - and if it's pressed against a surface it turns the transducer into a speaker!Often these size transducers are pressed up against a flat surface to turn it into a sounding board. The effect is a surprisingly clear sound that comes from the surface itself. The body of the transducer is heavy so that it can be placed with theÂ top down on a table. And for another fun trick, put the transducer at the end of a large plastic cup to point sound in a particular direction.This transducer is about 28mm in diameter and has 4Î© impedence and should be run at about 3W. It pairs great with any of our audio amps such as the TS2012 breakout or MAX98306.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2954,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 30 LED/m - BLACK,"There are 30 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size. Including ready-to-go library & example code for the Arduino UNO/Duemilanove/Diecimila, Flora/Micro/Leonardo, Trinket/Gemma, Arduino Due & Arduino Mega/ADK (all versions)",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-videos/1024x768/2954-05.jpg,2954.jpg,$84.75

https://www.adafruit.com/products/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1494,Cold Splice Wire Tap (UB) - 10 pack,"Kiss those days of heat-shrink, melted jacketing and clumsily-arranged third-hand tools goodbye! Go 'cold splice' with these snap-able plastic splices for fast connections. Use with any 22-26 AWG solid core wire and slip them into the plastic splice so that they slide into the metal teeth. Then squeeze down with parallel-jaw or slip joint pliers - don't use needle-noses, they have too much angle and not enough force. We also like using our panavise to squeeze them down.

This is a wire-tap splice. You can slide one half over an existing 22-26 AWG solid-core wire and then 'tap' into it with another wire. It's an easy way to tap into an existing wire without doing weird cut-solder surgery.

The splices contain a little silicone jelly to keep the cold splice from oxidizing so they are a bit weatherproof. They are not waterproof.

Comes in a pack of 10 pieces! They're handy so keep some around in your drawer.

If you want to power the shield with an external power supply, solder in the included terminal block (pro-tip: put it on the bottom of the board so it doesn't stick up) to wire in an external 4-6VDC power supply - that power supply will also power the Arduino and shield. If you want to use the terminal block to power the shield but keep the Arduino itself on DC or USB power only, cut the center of the solder jumper to the right of the terminal block. There's a polarity protection FET on the external input in case you wire the power backwards (we would never do that, it was, umm, a friend of ours, yeah that's it!)If, say, you need MORE blinky, you can chain these together. For the second shield, connect the DIN connection to the first shield's DOUT. Also connect a ground pin together and power with 5V. There you go! You can chain as many as you'd like although after 5 or more shields you may run low on RAM if you're using an UNO.We include both stacking headers and plain headers. Use whichever you prefer - there isn't a lot of space left over for the 'duino pin breakouts so if you want to wire up some other outputs or sensors the stacking headers are good. For a slim sturdy look, solder on the plain headers.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/772,LCD Shield Kit w/ 16x2 Character Display - Only 2 pins used! - BLUE AND WHITE,"This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the Blue & White 16x2 LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another pin to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's almost half of the pins available on a classic Arduino!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a shield that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Arduino! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.This shield is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The shield is designed for 'classic' Arduinos such as the Uno, Duemilanove, Diecimilla, etc. It uses the I2C pins at Analog 4 and Analog 5. It will also work perfectly with Arduino Mega R3's which have the extra SDA/SCL I2C pins broken out. Earlier Mega's have the I2C pins in a different location and will require you to solder two wires from the I2C pins on the shield and plug them into the different I2C locations at Digital 20 & 21.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality, USA-made PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). This product comes with a 16x2 Blue & White LCD. Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasingOf course, we even wrote an easy-to-use Arduino library that you can easily add to your project. It acts just like the built in LiquidCrystal library, but automatically uses the shield pins. You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the library and shield can control the backlight of our character LCDs by turning the LED on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this shield can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/772-03.jpg,/772.jpg,$19.95

The joystick is a 'self-centering' analog-type. That means it basically acts like two 10K potentiometers, one for up/down and another for left/right. Connect one the VCC pin to your power supply (3 or 5V is best) and the ground pin to ground. Then read the two remaining pins with an analog pin each. As the joystick is moved around, the voltage will follow the motion. When you release the joystick it will center itself. There are 4 pads on the bottom, you are best off soldering 4 wires to these pins and then gluing the whole thing down.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2831,Photo Transistor Light Sensor,"This Photo Transistor Light SensorÂ is aÂ simple sensor that detects ambient light.

This sensor has a built-in optical filter (probably IR filter) so it'll do a fair job of simulating light levels as the human eye does.Â  Basically, connect the pin connected to the 'thicker' part of the sensor to 3-15VDC or so, and the thinner-part pin through a ~1K-10K series resistor to ground. When its dark, there's almost no current flowing through the sensor or resistor and the analog voltage is near ground. When there's light near the sensor, the current through the resistor will increase, raising the voltage. You can adjust the series resistor to get the voltage range you need, and measure the analog voltage with a microcontroller.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/893,Wire Light LED Strand - 12 Warm White LEDs + Coin Cell Holder,"Add sparkle to your project with these lovely silver wire LED strands. These strands are very interesting, they use two silver wires that are coated so they don't short if they touch, then tiny 1000mcd LEDs are bonded onto the wires and coated with epoxy. The result is a very flexible silver wire with sparkly ""fairy"" lights that are much less visible than normal LEDs. They're still just LEDs, but in a fun new form-factor! They're even waterproof - you can dunk these or have them outdoors, just be sure to protect the battery holder.Each strand comes with 12 LEDs, approximately 5cm/2 inches apart for a 2 foot long strand of wire. At one end of the magnet wire, a double stranded-core wire is soldered on and heat-shrinked to protect it. A 2 x CR2032 coin cell holder with on/off switch is on the other side. Of course, if you want you can just cut the coin cell holder off and solder on a 3xAAA battery holder or 3xAA battery holder. To solder to the magnet wire, scrape off the coating first.Requires 2 x CR2032 batteries to run. Does not come with batteries, we do stock CR2032 batteries if you want to use them as is. Runs for about 8 hours continuously on two CR2032's.Please note: There are no series resistor installed in the strand, if you want to use another supply you will need to calculate and solder in a resistor. The reason that two 3V coin cells can be used to drive LEDs with a forward voltage of about 3.2V is that coin cells have an internal resistance that makes up for the lack of a choke resistor. If you want to drive these via a 6V power supply, you'll want to put in a 20-220 ohm (or larger) resistor in series to avoid burning out the LEDs. If you want to use a 4.5V power supply, use 10-100 ohms (or larger).",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/893-00.jpg,/893.jpg,$4.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2871,Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix - 64 RGBW - Natural - ~4500K,"The NeoPixel is 'split', one half is the RGBÂ you know and love, the other half is a white LED with a yellow phosphor. Unlit, it resembles an egg yolk. Lit up these are insanely bright (like ow my eye hurts) and can be controlled with 8-bit PWM per channel (8 x 4 channels = 32-bit color overall). Great for adding lots of colorful + white dots to your project!Wiring it up is easy: there are two 3-pin connection ports. Solder wires to the input port and provide 5VDC to the +5V and ground pins, then connect the DIN pin to your microcontroller. If you're using our NeoPixel Arduino library, use digital #6. You'll also need to make a common ground from the 5V power supply to the microcontroller/Arduino. Since each LED can draw as much as 60mA (thats up to 3.5 Amps per panel if all LEDs are on bright white!) we suggest our 5V 2A power supply. For most uses, you'll see about 1-2A of current per panel.If, say, you need MORE blinky, you can chain these together. For the second shield, connect the DIN connection to the first panel's DOUT. Also connect a ground pin together and power with 5V. There you go! You can chain as many as you'd like although after 4 or more panels you may run low on RAM if you're using an UNO. Watch your power usage too, you may need a 5V 10A power supply for so many of these!There is a single data line with a very timing-specific protocol. Since the protocol is very sensitive to timing, it requires a real-time microconroller such as an AVR, Arduino, PIC, mbed, etc. It cannot be used with a Linux-based microcomputer or interpreted microcontroller such as the netduino or Basic Stamp. Our wonderfully-written Neopixel library for Arduino supports these pixels! As it requires hand-tuned assembly it is only for AVR cores but others may have ported this chip driver code so please google around.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1616,Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver PCB for 4x4 Keypad & 3mm LEDs,"This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. Trellis is an open source backlight keypad driver system. It is easy to use, works with any 3mm LEDs and eight tiles can be tiled together on a shared I2C bus.This PCB is specially made to match the Adafruit 4x4 elastomer keypad. Each Trellis PCB has 4x4 pads and 4x4 matching spots for 3mm LEDs. The circuitry on-board handles the background key-presses and LED lighting for the 4x4 tile. However, it does not have any microcontroller or other 'brains' - an Arduino (or similar microcontroller) is required to control the Trellis to read the keypress data and let it know when to light up LEDs as desired.Each tile has an I2C-controlled LED sequencer and keypad reader already on it. The chip can control all 16 LEDs individually, turning them on or off. It cannot do grayscale or dimming. The same chip also reads any keypresses made with the rubber keypad. The connections are 'diode multiplexed' so you do not have to worry about ""ghosting"" when pressing multiple keys, each key is uniquely addressed.The tiles have 3 address jumpers. You can tile up to 8 PCBs together (for a total of 4x32 or 16x8=128 buttons/leds) on a single I2C bus, as long as each one has a unique address. All the tiles connect by the edges with solder, and share the same power, ground, interrupt, and i2c clock/data pins. So, you can easily set up to 128 LEDs and read up to 128 buttons using only 2 I2C wires! The tiles can be arranged in any configuration they want as long as each tile is connected to another with the 5 edge-fingers.Each LED is multiplexed with a constant-current driver, so you can mix and match any colors you like. You don't need it to be all blue, all red, etc. Mix it up! Any 3mm LED can be used, although we find that diffused LEDs with 250mcd+ brightness look best.This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. You'll probably want to pick up a matching button pad and also some 3mm diffused LEDs (we suggest red, blue or white which look best). Some soldering is required to put the LEDs into the PCB, and then attach wires that go from each Trellis to an Arduino microcontroller (or whatever microcontroller you prefer)We have an Arduino library & example code on github.We have a great tutorial with wiring diagrams, installation instructions and example code here",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1616-00.jpg,1616.jpg,$9.95

Unlit, it resembles an egg yolk. Lit up these are insanely bright (like ow my eye hurts) and can be controlled with 8-bit PWM per channel (8 x 4 channels = 32-bit color overall). Great for adding lots of colorful + white dots to your project!To make it easy to start, the LEDs are by default powered from the 5V onboard Arduino supply. As long as youÂ aren'tÂ lighting up all the pixels full power white that should be fine. If you want to power the shield with an external power supply, solder in the included terminal block (pro-tip: put it on the bottom of the board so it doesn't stick up) to wire in an external 4-6VDC power supply - that power supply will also power the Arduino and shield. If you want to use the terminal block to power the shield but keep the Arduino itself on DC or USB power only, cut the center of the solder jumper to the right of the terminal block. There's a polarity protection FET on the external input in case you wire the power backwards (we would never do that, it was, umm, a friend of ours, yeah that's it!)If, say, you need MORE blinky, you can chain these together. For the second shield, connect the DIN connection to the first shield's DOUT. Also connect a ground pin together and power with 5V. There you go! You can chain as many as you'd like although after 5 or more shields you may run low on RAM if you're using an UNO.We include both stacking headers and plain headers. Use whichever you prefer - there isn't a lot of space left over for the 'duino pin breakouts so if you want to wire up some other outputs or sensors the stacking headers are good. For a slim sturdy look, solder on the plain headers.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

These premium jumper wires are 3"" (75mm) long and come in a 'strip' of 40 (4 pieces of each of ten rainbow colors). They have 0.1"" male header contacts on either end and fit cleanly next to each other on standard-pitch 0.1"" (2.54mm) header. The best part is they come in a 40-pin ribbon cable. You can always pull the ribbon wires off to make individual jumpers, or keep them together to make neatly organized wire harnesses.We have these in three handy lengths: 3""/75mm, 6""/160mm and 12""/300mm. If you want the female/female type, we have those too!Note: The length of the jumper wires is sometimes a bit longer than what is listed.For best results, when plugging these in a line, have the sides with the 'silver latch bit' sticking out since that side is a tiny bit wider than 0.1""",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/759-04.jpg,/759.jpg,$3.95

Instead, logarithmic pots like this one increase their resistance on a curve. At the halfway point volume will still be moderate, but it will increase sharply as you keep turning up the volume. This corresponds to how the human ear hears.Â Using a log pot therefore gives the effect that a setting of full volume on the control sounds twice as loud as a setting of half volume. A linear pot used as a volume control would give large apparent changes in loudness at low volume settings, with little apparent change over the rest of the control's range.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3481-01.jpg,3481.jpg,$1.50

This makes the solenoid able to pull from one end, or push from the other.This solenoid in particular is chunkier than our little 5V one, with a 27mm long body, 10mm long throw, and a 'captive' armature with a return spring. This means that when activated with up to 6VDC, the solenoid moves and then the voltage is removed, it springs back to the original position, which is quite handy. Many lower cost solenoids are only push type or only pull type and may not have a captive armature (it'll fall out!) or don't have a return spring.Â ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3992-01.jpg,3992.jpg,$7.50

http://adafruit.com/product/1852,USB Charger Doctor - In-line Voltage and Current Meter,"Help! This patient is heating up! Is the voltage too low? Is the current draw too high? Is there a doctor in the house? Oh, thank goodness, the Charger Doctor is here! Right on time...Doctor, can you tell us what the current draw is? What about the voltage? Thanks to the Doctor, you will now be able to watch and care for your USB-powered projects.

Use the USB Charger Doctor to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.05 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. The Doctor's digital display instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones.

You can use this device from 3.5-7VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. It flips between voltage and current readouts every 3 seconds or so. It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1616,Adafruit Trellis Monochrome Driver PCB for 4x4 Keypad & 3mm LEDs,"This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. Trellis is an open source backlight keypad driver system. It is easy to use, works with any 3mm LEDs and eight tiles can be tiled together on a shared I2C bus.This PCB is specially made to match the Adafruit 4x4 elastomer keypad. Each Trellis PCB has 4x4 pads and 4x4 matching spots for 3mm LEDs. The circuitry on-board handles the background key-presses and LED lighting for the 4x4 tile. However, it does not have any microcontroller or other 'brains' - an Arduino (or similar microcontroller) is required to control the Trellis to read the keypress data and let it know when to light up LEDs as desired.Each tile has an I2C-controlled LED sequencer and keypad reader already on it. The chip can control all 16 LEDs individually, turning them on or off. It cannot do grayscale or dimming. The same chip also reads any keypresses made with the rubber keypad. The connections are 'diode multiplexed' so you do not have to worry about ""ghosting"" when pressing multiple keys, each key is uniquely addressed.The tiles have 3 address jumpers. You can tile up to 8 PCBs together (for a total of 4x32 or 16x8=128 buttons/leds) on a single I2C bus, as long as each one has a unique address. All the tiles connect by the edges with solder, and share the same power, ground, interrupt, and i2c clock/data pins. So, you can easily set up to 128 LEDs and read up to 128 buttons using only 2 I2C wires! The tiles can be arranged in any configuration they want as long as each tile is connected to another with the 5 edge-fingers.Each LED is multiplexed with a constant-current driver, so you can mix and match any colors you like. You don't need it to be all blue, all red, etc. Mix it up! Any 3mm LED can be used, although we find that diffused LEDs with 250mcd+ brightness look best.This item is just for the Trellis driver PCB assembly: LEDs and buttons not included. You'll probably want to pick up a matching button pad and also some 3mm diffused LEDs (we suggest red, blue or white which look best). Some soldering is required to put the LEDs into the PCB, and then attach wires that go from each Trellis to an Arduino microcontroller (or whatever microcontroller you prefer)We have an Arduino library & example code on github.We have a great tutorial with wiring diagrams, installation instructions and example code here",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1616-00.jpg,1616.jpg,$9.95

https://adafruit.com/product/1115,Adafruit Blue&White 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi,"This new Adafruit Pi Plate makes it easy to use a blue and white 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the 16x2 Character LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another 1 to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Pi!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.New, we've updated this Pi plate so the buttons on on the right side, which makes it a little more mechanically stableThis pi plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The plate is designed for both Revision 1 and Revision 2 Raspberry Pi's. It uses the I2C (SDA/SCL) pins. We have a special xtra-tall 26-pin header so the plate sits above the USB and Ethernet jacks. For Pi Model B+ and Pi 2, the resistors sit right above the new set of USB ports. To keep them from shorting against the metal, a piece of electrical tape must be placed onto the USB ports.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). A 16x2 Character blue&white monochrome LCD is included! Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasing You may get a 2-row or 1-row connector LCD, either will work fine.We also have some handy Python code to help you easily talk to the LCD and buttons You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the code and plate can control the white backlight on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this plate can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1115-00.jpg,1115.jpg,$19.95

Handy for when you need to measure something far away, or in wet conditions. This sensor is a little more expensive than the other waterproof version we have with a PVC cable because this one can be used up to 125Â°C - the limit of the sensor itself. That said, it's still not recommended for salt-water or corrosive environments since the stainless steel will eventually rust!Because the sensor signal is digital, you don't get any signal degradation even over long distances! These 1-wire digital temperature sensors are fairly precise (Â±0.5Â°C over much of the range) and can give up to 12 bits of precision from the onboard digital-to-analog converter. They work great with any microcontroller using a single digital pin, and you can even connect multiple ones to the same pin, each one has a unique 64-bit ID burned in at the factory to differentiate them. Usable with 3.0-5.0V systems.The only downside is they use the Dallas 1-Wire protocol, which is somewhat complex, and requires a bunch of code to parse out the communication. If you want something really simple, and you have an analog input pin, the TMP36 is trivial to get going.You'll need a 4.7k resistor which is required as a pullup from the DATA to VCC line when using the sensor. Here's a CircuitPython/Python guide for these sensors. We don't have a detailed Arduino tutorial, but you can get started by using the Dallas Temperature Control Arduino library which requires also the OneWire Library.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3846-02.jpg,3846.jpg,$21.95

http://adafruit.com/product/1138,Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - White 60 LED - WHITE,"These LED strips are even more fun and glowy. There are 60 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for you.The strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 0.65""/1.7cm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need! We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meter (depending on use) and a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 4 meters (depending on use) You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThey come in 4 meter reels with a 2 or 3-pin JST SM connector on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips are sold by the meter! If you buy 4 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 4m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.Â If the piece comes from the end of the reel, the connector may be on the output end of the strip!To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1667,"7"" Display 1280x800 (720p) IPS + Speakers - HDMI/VGA/NTSC/PAL","Yes, this is an adorable small HDMI television with incredibly high resolution and built in 3W stereo speakers! We tried to get the smallest possible HDMI/VGA display with high-res, high-contrast visibility. The visible display measures only 7"" (17.8cm) diagonal, and the TFT comes in an enclosure with HDMI, VGA and Composite inputs. The display is very easy to use - simply connect a 9 to 12VDC adapter to the 2.1mm center-positive DC jack (not included) then connect a digital video source to one of the ports. Voila, a television display!

There's some little buttons on the front that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It auto-detects which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu which to display. It comes with a basic stand (shown) and there are four 'mounting thread' holes in the back in a 75mmx75mm square and you can use M4 screws to attach it to an enclosure. There's also a ""Camera Mount"" 1/4-20 hole in the bottom so you can attach it to a camera-ready mount.

To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI, VGA or NTSC/PAL output. It will not work with a device that only outputs DVI (without a DVI to HDMI adapter) or SECAM.

There's also a slot in the side for a USB stick. In theory if you put some MP3's , pictures or videos on the stick and plug it in you can use the display as a viewer (but we haven't tried it). There'a also an audio line-in 3.5mm jack, so if you want to use VGA you can pipe in audio from an external source. It doesn't work with NTSC input though! The + and - buttons on the front allow you to quickly change the speaker volume. Its not a HiFi but its fairly loud and good for movies & games.

Works great with a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black, as well as our XBox, Windows desktop and Macbook (with an HDMI adapter cable). Some OS's such as Windows may require you to set the audio output to the external display but with the XBox & RasPi it immediately used the speakers without any poking or prodding.

A power adapter is not included. Any 9 to 12VDC adapter will work nicely: we prefer 9V DC. Video will work with 5-12V but the audio amplifier requires 9-12V so if you want the speakers to work, 9V is best. Check the technical tabs for current draw at various voltages.

It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a capacitive-touch version of this shield here)We've updated our original v1 shield to an SPI display - its a tiny bit slower but uses a lot less pins and is now much easier to use with Mega & Leonardo. We also include an SPI touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. Even with all the extras, the price is lower thanks to our parts sourcing & engineering skillz!The shield is fully assembled, tested and ready to go. No wiring, no soldering! Simply plug it in and load up our library - you'll have it running in under 10 minutes! Works best with any classic Arduino (UNO/Duemilanove/Diecimila). Solder three jumpers and you can use it at full speed on a Leonardo or Mega as well.This display shield has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. This shield needs fewer pins than our v1 shield, so you can connect more sensors, buttons and LEDs: 5 SPI pins for the display, another pin for the SPI touchscreen controller and another pin for uSD card if you want to read images off of it.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles and text. We also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure) and example code to demonstrate all of it. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller!For people who want the same screen but not in a shield form-factor, check out our 2.8"" TFT breakout",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1651-00.jpg,1651.jpg,$34.95

https://www.adafruit.com/product/4237,Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with Short Cable - 3.7V 350mAh,"The included protection circuitry keeps the battery voltage from going too high (over-charging) or low (over-use) which means that the battery will cut-out when completely dead at 3.0V. It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 350mA or less. We suggest our Micro Lipo charger, which has a 100mA default rate. Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1 C or even less - 100 to 350mA is a good rate, and available from any USB port if using a USB-powered chargerAdditional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery.

Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

It has a black soldermask and gold plated finish. Once assembled with its case, Alpha Clock Five is approximately 9.44"" wide, 3.78"" tall, and 2.80"" deep.ChronoDotAlpha Clock Five comes complete with a Chronodot real-time clock module. It provides your clock kit with (1) a higher accuracy quartz crystal oscillator, (2) a backup battery, and (3) extra geek cred for having a TCXO-based RTC. The included battery is estimated to last for 7 years.USB-TTL CableYou may be interested to add an optional FTDI USB-TTL converter cable, which provides an optional interface between your computer and your clock. It can be used (1) to sync the clock's time to the time on your PC, (2) to reprogram the clock through (a modified version of) the Arduino IDE, or (3) to send serial data to display on the five-character LED display. Note, however, that these are entirely optional operations-- no programming is needed to build or use an Alpha Clock Five clock kit!Power supplyThe Alpha Clock Five kit includes a universal-input power supply that will work with worldwide voltages. The plug is a power-strip-friendly US type, so you may need an inexpensive ""grocery store"" plug adapter to fit the wall socket in your country.If you need to provide power from an alternate source, Alpha Clock Five requires (and provides hookup locations for) a regulated 5 V dc power supply with 1 A capacityÂ ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/620-00.jpg,/620.jpg,$145.00

https://www.adafruit.com/product/519,Conductive Rubber Cord Stretch Sensor + extras!,"Measuring stretch forces isn't easy - unless you have some conductive rubber cord! This cord is 2mm diameter, and 1 meter long, made of carbon-black impregnated rubber. Usually this material is used for EMF gasketing, but its also very fun to play with.In a 'relaxed' state, the resistance is about 350 ohms per inch. As you pull on it, the resistance increases (the particles get further apart). As you stretch it out, the resistance increases. So lets say you have a 6"" piece - thats about 2.1 Kohms. Stretch it to 10"" long and now it is 10""/6""*2.1K = 3.5 Kohms. You can stretch the rubber about 50-70% longer than the resting length, so a 6"" piece shouldn't be stretched more than 10"". Once the force is released, the rubber will shrink back, although its not very 'fast' and it takes a minute or two to revert to its original length. It's not a true linear sensor, and the resistance may vary from batch to batch, so we consider it a way to measure stretching motion but isn't really precise.This stuff is fun, so we give you a full meter and also two alligator clips (to connect to the cord) and a 10K resistor. Together, you can use these to make a simple voltage divider. Then use our handy Thermistor tutorial to measure the analog voltage and convert that back to resistance.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/519-03.jpg,/519.jpg,$9.95

This microcontroller contains a Tensilica chip core as well as a full WiFi stack. You can program the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE for an easy-to-run Internet of Things core. We wired up a high-quality SiLabs CP2104 USB-Serial chip that can upload code at a blistering 921600 baud for fast development time. It also has auto-reset so no noodling with pins and reset button pressings. The CP2104 has better driver support than the CH340 and can do very high speeds without stability issues.,https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2821-05.jpg,2821.jpg,$16.95

The tag contains a small RFID chip and an antenna, and is passively powered by the reader/writer when placed a couple inches away.These can be read by almostÂ any 13.56MHz RFID/NFC reader, but make sure it can handle ISO/IEC 14443 Type A cards (the standard NTAG uses) as there are a few other encoding standards (like FeLica).These chips can be written to andÂ store up to 144 bytes of data in writable EEPROM divided into 4 byte banks, and can handle over 10,000 re-writes. You can use ourÂ PN532 NFC/RFID breakout boardÂ orÂ Adafruit NFC/RFID Shield for ArduinoÂ to read and write data to the EEPROM inside the tag. There is also a permanent 7-byte serial number ID burned into the chip that you can use to identify one tag from another - the ID number cannot be changed.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4033-01.jpg,4033.jpg,$2.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/2949,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 30 LED/m - WHITE,"There are 30 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

It's aÂ 84x48 pixel monochrome LCD display. These displays are small, only about 1.5"" diagonal, but very readable and come with a white backlight. This display is made of 84x48 individual pixels, so you can use it for graphics, text or bitmaps. These displays are inexpensive, easy to use, require only a few digital I/O pins and are fairly low power as wellTo drive the display, you will need 3 to 5 digital output pins (depending on whether you want to manually control the chip select and reset lines). Another pin can be used to control (via on/off or PWM) the backlight - the backlight LEDs are wired to a transistor.The display driver is a PCD8544 chip, and it runs at 3.3V so you'll need a 3V supply handy (you don't need that much current though, maybe 10mA tops). Logic levels must be 3V to prevent damage but we include a free level shifter chip so you can easily connect it to 5V logic such as an Arduino.These screens are recycled from older cell phones so they often have tiny nicks or scratches. There's no such thing as a 'new' Nokia 5110 display, but the scratches are not noticeable when in use.Of course, we wouldn't just point you to a datasheet and say ""good luck!"" To make it easy for you to use the display, we've written a nice graphics library that can print text, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines!

This product comes with a new 9.7"" diagonal TFT display module (the same one used in the iPad 3 & 4), along with our custom made driver board, a stand-up monitor enclosure kit, 10' DisplayPort cable and 9V power adapter.

The driver board is a work of art (it was designed by resident engineer KTOWN) - and we use the really awesome LT3754 as a 12-channel constant current driver with individual backlight string channel control. This gives the backlight perfect consistency over any usage or temperature range. A ATtiny85 handles the backlight dimming and soft on/off, so you can PWM the backlight over a range to get the look you want.

Comes with a display panel already attached, tested and ready to go. The plastic enclosure kit takes 30 minutes to put together using only a small screwdriver and will protect your display. Plug in the power and connect the DisplayPort cable. Ta-da display working immediately! No drivers, soldering, configuration or other converters required.

Use as a main screen or even better, as a secondary monitor. Great for photo or video editing - you can use a large main monitor for frame-by-frame editing and then preview on the smaller side frame. Or keep your email or dashboard notifications on the side. Heck, web-devs will want to use it to preview what their sites will look like on a ""Retina"" display. The 9.7"" screen is small enough to keep out of the way.

A motherboard DisplayPort is required for this monitor, and you cannot plug this into an HDMI port. If you need an HDMI display, check out our HDMI offerings.

This monitor kit comes as a kit of parts, and requires assembly Check out our tutorial for instruction on how to assemble the kit, no soldering is required but it does take about half an hour to put together and a small flathead screwdriver is used to assemble the case.

Billie has a big-sister relationship with Ruby, and admires her enthusiasm. Billie sings and speaks in a rough and breathy alto. Her catchphrase is ""it's enough to make a girl feel kinda blueâ€¦"", typically before breaking into song.About LEDs:LEDs are two-terminal electronic devices, and are a special type of diode. The first modern LEDs were created by engineer Nick Holonyak in 1962 at General Electric. When electrons cross part of the diffusion region of a diode (an area called the band gap), a photon is emitted. The size of the band gap determines the wavelength (color) of the photon. LEDs are available in many wavelengths ranging from infrared to ultraviolet.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1027-05.jpg,1027.jpg,$9.95

This is the stuff used to make flexible circuits, but raw and unetched. You can treat it just like 1 oz copper clad, etch it with ferric chloride (or other PCB etching systems) or cut with scissors. It may even be possible to laser or CNC engrave (we haven't tried it ourselves but we'd love to hear about it if you get any results.)Pyralux is the brand name of Dupont's flex PCB material that's used in cell phones and other small circuits. One side of it's 1 oz copper while the other side is polyamide for strength and flexibility. The material can be manipulated through and around small areas and won't crack as easily as copper tape. Pyralux is used in a ton of consumer-grade electronics and one of the reasons why things like your cell phones have advanced from bulky and cumbersome to miniature super computers.Comes with a 6""x6"" (152mm x 152mm) square of Pyralux. It's ED-Y type copper at 35um (1 oz/ft2) and has a polymide of 25um (1 mil). The thick copper layer means it can carry a lot of current, and its trivial to solder to it. We have a little demo of it with a 1W LED above.All of this makes Pyralux yet another great material for your next wearables project or whatever project you come up with!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1894-01.jpg,1894.jpg,$9.95

It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. (We also have a capacitive-touch version of this shield here)We've updated our original v1 shield to an SPI display - its a tiny bit slower but uses a lot less pins and is now much easier to use with Mega & Leonardo. We also include an SPI touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. Even with all the extras, the price is lower thanks to our parts sourcing & engineering skillz!The shield is fully assembled, tested and ready to go. No wiring, no soldering! Simply plug it in and load up our library - you'll have it running in under 10 minutes! Works best with any classic Arduino (UNO/Duemilanove/Diecimila). Solder three jumpers and you can use it at full speed on a Leonardo or Mega as well.This display shield has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. This shield needs fewer pins than our v1 shield, so you can connect more sensors, buttons and LEDs: 5 SPI pins for the display, another pin for the SPI touchscreen controller and another pin for uSD card if you want to read images off of it.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles and text. We also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure) and example code to demonstrate all of it. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller!For people who want the same screen but not in a shield form-factor, check out our 2.8"" TFT breakout",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1651-00.jpg,1651.jpg,$34.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

Is there a doctor in the house? Oh, thank goodness, the Charger Doctor is here! Right on time...Doctor, can you tell us what the current draw is? What about the voltage? Thanks to the Doctor, you will now be able to watch and care for your USB-powered projects.

Use the USB Charger Doctor to measure the working voltage and current output for any USB port and project. This blue plastic dongle plugs between a USB device, and passes the data lines through. There's a 0.05 ohm resistor in line with the power pin that is used to measure current draw. The Doctor's digital display instantly reads the numbers out for testing devices such as chargers, cables, and cell phones.

You can use this device from 3.5-7VDC input voltage (although most USB devices tend to hover around 4.75 to 5.25) and up to 3A of current. It flips between voltage and current readouts every 3 seconds or so. It's a very handy tool for testing USB devices, checking load levels and debugging battery chargers and boost converters. It's a little chunkier, but more numerical than our USB Power Gauge Mini-Kit. It's also not open source so check out the USB Power Gauge mini kit if you want to hack together your own power gauge indicator.

Pick up any of our many 3.7V/4.2V LiIon batteries, and a 6V solar panel. Plug the battery into the BATT port using a 2-pin JST cable and the solar panel into the DC jack using a 2.1mm adapter cable Put the solar panel outside (and keep the battery out of the sun, it needs to be kept cool!) to start charging. You can power another project like a Mintyboost at the same time by connecting to the LOAD output portOur carefully designed charger is designed specifically for solar charging, and will automatically draw the most current possible from the panel in any light condition! Even thought it isn't a 'true' MPPT (max power point tracker), it has near-identical performance without the additional cost of a buck-converter. Our detailed tutorial on how to use this charger includes a design document explaining how it all works.For use with Adafruit Lipoly/LiIon batteries only! Other batteries may have different voltage, chemistry, polarity or pinout.Comes with an assembled charger board, a 2-pin JST cable that will fit into either the BATT or LOAD ports, and a large stabilization capacitor that must be installed in your finished project.

Inside are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity). The other is a magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. By combining this data you can then orient your project!We based this breakout on the latest version of this popular sensor, the LSM303DLHC. This compact sensor uses I2C to communicate and its very easy to use. Since it's a 3.3V max chip, we added circuitry to make it 5V-safe logic and power, for easy use with either 3 or 5V microcontrollers. Simply connect VCC to +3-5V and ground to ground. Then read data from the I2C clock and data pins. There's also a Data Ready and two Interrupt pins you can use (check the LSM303 datasheet for details)If using with an Arduino, its extra-easy to get started as we already wrote a nice little Arduino library to get you started. Simply download our library and connect the SCL pin to your Arduino's I2C clock pin, and SDA pin to your Arduino's I2C data pin and upload our test program to read out accelerometer and magnetic field data.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1120-00.jpg,1120.jpg,$14.95

Simply press down on the top, place the chip in carefully and then release to latch the chip in. The chip is held securely against gold 'fingers' in the socket. 200mil or wider chips will not fit, but we do have other sockets for medium/wide SOIC chips.

The socket is soldered onto a pair of PCBs that turn it into, essentially, a 16 pin DIP with 0.6"" spacing that can be breadboarded fairly easily. Since the socket is a 16 pin socket that has been sectioned off to be only 8 pin, there are 16 pins in the breadboard, simply use 4 on each side and ignore the other 8 pins - they do provide mechanical stability when plugged into a breadboard

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2949,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 30 LED/m - WHITE,"There are 30 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

On the back there are 3 contacts for the button (common, normally-open and normally-closed) and 2 for the blue LED ring (+ and -). Connect 3 to 6V to the LED to have it light up nicely, there's a built in resistor! If you want to use this with a higher voltage, say 12V or 24V, simply add a 470 ohm resistor in series with the LED connection to keep the LED current at around 20mA.This button is a momentary push button, when you press it the 'normally-open' contact shorts to the common contact. When you release it, the contacts open up again.The switch and LED are separated, so you could wire it to turn on when pressed or vice versa or whatever you wish!

You can use this as a display for running the X interface, or pygame. You can also have an HDMI display seperately connected. There's four mounting ears that can be used to attach the display & Pi to a bezel, or snap them off with pliers (they're perforated) for a slick exactly-the-same-size-as-a-Pi look.We've created a custom kernel package based of off Notro's awesome framebuffer work, so you can install it over your existing Raspbian (or derivative) images in just a few commands. Our tutorial shows you how to install the software, as well as calibrate the touchscreen, display images such as from your PiCam and more!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/2441-10.jpg,2441.jpg,$44.95

http://adafruit.com/product/1667,"7"" Display 1280x800 (720p) IPS + Speakers - HDMI/VGA/NTSC/PAL","Yes, this is an adorable small HDMI television with incredibly high resolution and built in 3W stereo speakers! We tried to get the smallest possible HDMI/VGA display with high-res, high-contrast visibility. The visible display measures only 7"" (17.8cm) diagonal, and the TFT comes in an enclosure with HDMI, VGA and Composite inputs. The display is very easy to use - simply connect a 9 to 12VDC adapter to the 2.1mm center-positive DC jack (not included) then connect a digital video source to one of the ports. Voila, a television display!

There's some little buttons on the front that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It auto-detects which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu which to display. It comes with a basic stand (shown) and there are four 'mounting thread' holes in the back in a 75mmx75mm square and you can use M4 screws to attach it to an enclosure. There's also a ""Camera Mount"" 1/4-20 hole in the bottom so you can attach it to a camera-ready mount.

To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI, VGA or NTSC/PAL output. It will not work with a device that only outputs DVI (without a DVI to HDMI adapter) or SECAM.

There's also a slot in the side for a USB stick. In theory if you put some MP3's , pictures or videos on the stick and plug it in you can use the display as a viewer (but we haven't tried it). There'a also an audio line-in 3.5mm jack, so if you want to use VGA you can pipe in audio from an external source. It doesn't work with NTSC input though! The + and - buttons on the front allow you to quickly change the speaker volume. Its not a HiFi but its fairly loud and good for movies & games.

Works great with a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black, as well as our XBox, Windows desktop and Macbook (with an HDMI adapter cable). Some OS's such as Windows may require you to set the audio output to the external display but with the XBox & RasPi it immediately used the speakers without any poking or prodding.

A power adapter is not included. Any 9 to 12VDC adapter will work nicely: we prefer 9V DC. Video will work with 5-12V but the audio amplifier requires 9-12V so if you want the speakers to work, 9V is best. Check the technical tabs for current draw at various voltages.

This display is made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness!The driver chip, SSD1306 can communicate in two ways: I2C or SPI. The OLED itself require a 3.3V power supply and 3.3V logic levels for communication, but we include a 3.3V regulator and all pins are fully level shifted so you can use with 5V devices!The power requirements depend a little on how much of the display is lit but on average the display uses about 40mA from the 3.3V supply. Built into the OLED driver is a simple switch-cap charge pump that turns 3.3v-5v into a high voltage drive for the OLEDs.We have a detailed tutorial and example code in the form of an Arduino library for text and graphics. You'll need a microcontroller with more than 1K of RAM since the display must be buffered. The library can print text, bitmaps, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines.

The Pi will boot up and create a new secure wireless access point called Onion Pi. Connecting to that access point will automatically route any web browsing from your computer through the anonymizing Tor network.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1406-01.jpg,1406.jpg,$74.95

https://adafruit.com/product/2954,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 30 LED/m - BLACK,"There are 30 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

http://adafruit.com/product/1459,Inductive Charging Set - 3.3V @ 500mA max,"The squarish board with two chips on it is the transmitter (power with 9V). Â The longer board is the output andÂ you can connect that to the part ofÂ your project that needs powering.

Inductive charging is a way of powering a device without a direct wire connection. Most people have seen inductive charging in a rechargable electric toothbrush: you may have noticed that you recharge it by placing it into the holder, but there's no direct plug. These chargers work by taking a power transformer and splitting it in half, an AC waveform is generated into one, and couples into the second coil.

This is a basic charger set, and it does work, providing 3.3V DC output from the output half when the input half is powered with 9V to 12VDC. You can draw as much as 500mA if the coils are 2 or 3 mm apart. If you only need 100 or 200mA you can be up 7mm apart. For 10mA draw, the coils can be up to half an inch (12.5mm) apart. Any non-ferrous/non-conductive material (eg air, wood, leather, plastic, paper, glass) can be used between the two coils. The material doesn't affect the distance or efficiency. The coils do need to be fairly co-axial, try to get them to be parallel and have the circles line up for best power-transfer. (This is why the electric toothbrush must fit into the plastic holder, it's lining up the two coils for best efficiency.)

Because it's an air-core transformer, it's fairly inefficient. Only about 40% of the energy in shows up on the other end, but for low power or charging project. If you draw 5V 100mA on the output side (0.5W), you'll need 0.5W * 2.5 / 9V = ~150mA from the input end. The quiescent current is about 70mA at all time, even when the other coil is not anywhere near by.

These are basic modules, probably used for some low cost toy. We don't have any datasheets or specifications for them. We do see a feedback resistor divider on the output side using 0603 SMT resistors so an advanced user could solder in different values to turn it into a different valued output.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1459-02.jpg,1459.jpg,$9.95

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1026,Gus the Green LED - Circuit Playground Plushie,"Gus is the smartest member of the group, but also the most coarse. Gus is the closest thing to an engineer in the group: he is pragmatic, realistic and somewhat world-weary, but not a total downer. He will sometimes cut people off mid-sentence because he is impatient, not because he's trying to be mean or rude. Gus will occasionally make pithy observations that shed light on some problem or other. He is sort of an older brother to Ruby. Gus speaks in a New York / New Jersey accent. He often says things like ""that ain't gonna work"" or ""maybe we should do somethin' else."" His catchphrase is ""don't go nuts,"" typically in response to some suggested crazy scheme, though he is usually ignored.About LEDs: LEDs are two-terminal electronic devices, and are a special type of diode. The first modern LEDs were created by engineer Nick Holonyak in 1962 at General Electric. When electrons cross part of the diffusion region of a diode (an area called the band gap), a photon is emitted. The size of the band gap determines the wavelength (color) of the photon.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/938,"Monochrome 1.3"" 128x64 OLED graphic display","These displays are small, only about 1.3"" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This display is made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness!The driver chip, SSD1306 can communicate in two ways: I2C or SPI. The OLED itself require a 3.3V power supply and 3.3V logic levels for communication, but we include a 3.3V regulator and all pins are fully level shifted so you can use with 5V devices!The power requirements depend a little on how much of the display is lit but on average the display uses about 40mA from the 3.3V supply. Built into the OLED driver is a simple switch-cap charge pump that turns 3.3v-5v into a high voltage drive for the OLEDs.We have a detailed tutorial and example code in the form of an Arduino library for text and graphics. You'll need a microcontroller with more than 1K of RAM since the display must be buffered. The library can print text, bitmaps, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines. It uses 1K of RAM since it needs to buffer the entire display but its very fast! The code is simple to adapt to any other microcontroller.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/938-15.jpg,/938.jpg,$19.95

https://adafruit.com/product/395,8-channel Bi-directional Logic Level Converter - TXB0108,"Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V.Although one can use resistors to make a divider, for high speed transfers, the resistors can add a lot of slew and cause havoc that is tough to debug. For that reason, we like using 4050/74LVX245 series and similar logic to perform proper level shifting. Only problem is that they are only good in one direction which can be a problem for some specialty bi-diectional interfaces and also makes wiring a little hairy.That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in! This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Only thing that doesn't work well with this chip is i2c (because it uses strong pullups which confuse auto-direction sensor). If you need to use pullups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm - the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK! Its a little more luxurious than a 74LVX245 but if you just don't want to worry about directional pins this is a life saver!Since this chip is a special bi-directional level shifter it does not have strong output pins that can drive LEDs or long cables, it's meant to sit on a breadboard between two logic chips! If you do not need instant bi-directional support, we suggest the 74LVX245 as below which has strong output drive.This breakout saves you from having to solder the very fine pitch packages that this chip comes with. We also add 0.1uF caps onto both sides and a 10K pull-up resistor on the output enable pin so you can use it right out of the box!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/395-06.jpg,/395.jpg,$8.00

There's a 2x13 'classic Pi' connection GPIO header on the bottom, you can connect a 26-pin Pi GPIO cable to it to use any of the other pins as you like. The other GPIO are broken out into solder pads at the bottom, in case you want to use more of the GPIO.Best of all, it comes fully assembled and ready to plug into your Pi! You can use this as a display for running the X interface, or pygame. You can also have an HDMI display seperately connected. There's four mounting ears that can be used to attach the display & Pi to a bezel, or snap them off with pliers (they're perforated) for a slick exactly-the-same-size-as-a-Pi look.We've created a custom kernel package based of off Notro's awesome framebuffer work, so you can install it over your existing Raspbian (or derivative) images in just a few commands.

http://adafruit.com/product/4311,"2.0"" 320x240 Color IPS TFT Display with microSD Card Breakout","This gorgeous IPS display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project, with excellent visibility from any angle. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!The 2.0"" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! Not only that, but its an IPS display for vivid color and high-angle visibility. The TFT driver (ST7789) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades), but almost all drivers will use just 16-bit color. The TFT will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator, auto-reset circuitry, and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller! Wiring is easy, we strongly encourage using the hardware SPI pins of your Arduino as software SPI is noticeably slower when dealing with this size display.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/4311-06.jpg,4311.jpg,$19.95

It will also protect against output shorts. However, even with this protection it is very important that you only use a LiIon/LiPoly constant-voltage/constant-current charger to recharge them and at a rate of 420mA or less. We suggest our Micro Lipo charger, which has a 100mA default rate. Like most lipos, the batteries we sell do not have thermistors built in. This is why we suggest charging at 1 C or even less - 100 to 420mA is a good rate, and available from any USB port if using a USB-powered chargerAdditional safety notes: Do not use a NiMH/NiCad/lead-acid charger! Also, do not abuse these batteries, do not short, bend, crush or puncture. Never charge or use unattended. Always inspect batteries and surrounding circuitry constantly for any damage, loose wiring, or possibility of short circuits. Polarity matches all Adafruit LiPoly/LiIon chargers and boards, other brands may have reverse polarity and can destroy your battery.

This powerful shield features the VS1053, an encoding/decoding (codec) chip that can decode a wide variety of audio formats such as MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, WMA, MIDI, FLAC, WAV (PCM and ADPCM). It can also be used to record audio in both PCM (WAV) and compressed Ogg Vorbis. You can do all sorts of stuff with the audio as well such as adjusting bass, treble, and volume digitally.All this functionality is implemented in a light-weight SPI interface so that any Arduino can play audio from an SD card. There's also a special MIDI mode that you can boot the chip into that will read 'classic' 31250Kbaud MIDI data from an Arduino pin and act like a synth/drum machine - there are dozens of built-in drum and sample effects! But the chip is a pain to solder, and needs a lot of extras. That's why we spun up the best shield, perfect for use with any Arduino Uno, Leonardo or Mega.This version of the shield only has stereo line/headphone output. We also have a version with a 3W/channel class-D stereo speaker amplifier for easy use in projects that need to be loudWe believe this is the best MP3 playing shield you can get, and at a great price too.

Unlike the low cost ""Nokia 6110"" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340 or compatible) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades!). And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included, but you can pick one up here.Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a ""good luck!"" - we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, text and bitmaps as well as example code. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller! Wiring is easy, we strongly encourage using the hardware SPI pins of your Arduino as software SPI is noticeably slower when dealing with this size display.

Ah, if only you had this triple-axis accelerometer/magnetometer compass module. Inside are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity). The other is a magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. By combining this data you can then orient your project!We based this breakout on the latest version of this popular sensor, the LSM303DLHC. This compact sensor uses I2C to communicate and its very easy to use. Since it's a 3.3V max chip, we added circuitry to make it 5V-safe logic and power, for easy use with either 3 or 5V microcontrollers. Simply connect VCC to +3-5V and ground to ground. Then read data from the I2C clock and data pins. There's also a Data Ready and two Interrupt pins you can use (check the LSM303 datasheet for details)If using with an Arduino, its extra-easy to get started as we already wrote a nice little Arduino library to get you started. Simply download our library and connect the SCL pin to your Arduino's I2C clock pin, and SDA pin to your Arduino's I2C data pin and upload our test program to read out accelerometer and magnetic field data.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1120-00.jpg,1120.jpg,$14.95

When its dark, there's almost no current flowing through the sensor or resistor and the analog voltage is near ground. When there's light near the sensor, the current through the resistor will increase, raising the voltage.

http://www.adafruit.com/product/1115,Adafruit Blue&White 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi,"This new Adafruit Pi Plate makes it easy to use a blue and white 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the 16x2 Character LCDs we stock in the shop. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another 1 to control the backlight for a total of 7 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Pi!With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.New, we've updated this Pi plate so the buttons on on the right side, which makes it a little more mechanically stableThis pi plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.The plate is designed for both Revision 1 and Revision 2 Raspberry Pi's. It uses the I2C (SDA/SCL) pins. We have a special xtra-tall 26-pin header so the plate sits above the USB and Ethernet jacks. For Pi Model B+ and Pi 2, the resistors sit right above the new set of USB ports. To keep them from shorting against the metal, a piece of electrical tape must be placed onto the USB ports.This product comes as a kit! Included is a high quality PCB and all the components (buttons, header etc). A 16x2 Character blue&white monochrome LCD is included! Assembly is easy, even if you've never soldered before and the kit can be completed in 30 minutes.  Check the product tutorial page for assembly instructions before purchasing You may get a 2-row or 1-row connector LCD, either will work fine.We also have some handy Python code to help you easily talk to the LCD and buttons You can also easily query the 5 keypad buttons to get input through the library, so you get extra buttons without using any more pins. The buttons are automatically de-bounced inside the library.At this time, the code and plate can control the white backlight on or off. There is no support for PWM control of the backlight at this time, so if you need to have more granular control of the backlight, this plate can't do that (the I2C expander does not have PWM output).Product page with tutorials, documentation and assembly information",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1115-00.jpg,1115.jpg,$19.95

The only down-side is that they do not fit into 2.5mm spaced holes (they're 3.5mm spaced) - but they do fit in most perf/proto-board if you rotate them diagonally (see photo above). They don't fit nicely into solderless breadboards.These terminal blocks are designed to 'snap' together.

It has a black soldermask and gold plated finish. Once assembled with its case, Alpha Clock Five is approximately 9.44"" wide, 3.78"" tall, and 2.80"" deep.ChronoDotAlpha Clock Five comes complete with a Chronodot real-time clock module. It provides your clock kit with (1) a higher accuracy quartz crystal oscillator, (2) a backup battery, and (3) extra geek cred for having a TCXO-based RTC. The included battery is estimated to last for 7 years.USB-TTL CableYou may be interested to add an optional FTDI USB-TTL converter cable, which provides an optional interface between your computer and your clock. It can be used (1) to sync the clock's time to the time on your PC, (2) to reprogram the clock through (a modified version of) the Arduino IDE, or (3) to send serial data to display on the five-character LED display. Note, however, that these are entirely optional operations-- no programming is needed to build or use an Alpha Clock Five clock kit!Power supplyThe Alpha Clock Five kit includes a universal-input power supply that will work with worldwide voltages. The plug is a power-strip-friendly US type, so you may need an inexpensive ""grocery store"" plug adapter to fit the wall socket in your country.If you need to provide power from an alternate source, Alpha Clock Five requires (and provides hookup locations for) a regulated 5 V dc power supply with 1 A capacityÂ ",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/620-00.jpg,/620.jpg,$145.00

Unlit, it resembles an egg yolk. Lit up these are insanely bright (like ow my eye hurts) and can be controlled with 8-bit PWM per channel (8 x 4 channels = 32-bit color overall). Great for adding lots of colorful + white dots to your project!To make it easy to start, the LEDs are by default powered from the 5V onboard Arduino supply. As long as youÂ aren'tÂ lighting up all the pixels full power white that should be fine. If you want to power the shield with an external power supply, solder in the included terminal block (pro-tip: put it on the bottom of the board so it doesn't stick up) to wire in an external 4-6VDC power supply - that power supply will also power the Arduino and shield. If you want to use the terminal block to power the shield but keep the Arduino itself on DC or USB power only, cut the center of the solder jumper to the right of the terminal block. There's a polarity protection FET on the external input in case you wire the power backwards (we would never do that, it was, umm, a friend of ours, yeah that's it!)If, say, you need MORE blinky, you can chain these together. For the second shield, connect the DIN connection to the first shield's DOUT. Also connect a ground pin together and power with 5V. There you go! You can chain as many as you'd like although after 5 or more shields you may run low on RAM if you're using an UNO.We include both stacking headers and plain headers. Use whichever you prefer - there isn't a lot of space left over for the 'duino pin breakouts so if you want to wire up some other outputs or sensors the stacking headers are good. For a slim sturdy look, solder on the plain headers.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

https://adafruit.com/product/1459,Inductive Charging Set - 3.3V @ 500mA max,"The squarish board with two chips on it is the transmitter (power with 9V). Â The longer board is the output andÂ you can connect that to the part ofÂ your project that needs powering.

Inductive charging is a way of powering a device without a direct wire connection. Most people have seen inductive charging in a rechargable electric toothbrush: you may have noticed that you recharge it by placing it into the holder, but there's no direct plug. These chargers work by taking a power transformer and splitting it in half, an AC waveform is generated into one, and couples into the second coil.

This is a basic charger set, and it does work, providing 3.3V DC output from the output half when the input half is powered with 9V to 12VDC. You can draw as much as 500mA if the coils are 2 or 3 mm apart. If you only need 100 or 200mA you can be up 7mm apart. For 10mA draw, the coils can be up to half an inch (12.5mm) apart. Any non-ferrous/non-conductive material (eg air, wood, leather, plastic, paper, glass) can be used between the two coils. The material doesn't affect the distance or efficiency. The coils do need to be fairly co-axial, try to get them to be parallel and have the circles line up for best power-transfer. (This is why the electric toothbrush must fit into the plastic holder, it's lining up the two coils for best efficiency.)

Because it's an air-core transformer, it's fairly inefficient. Only about 40% of the energy in shows up on the other end, but for low power or charging project. If you draw 5V 100mA on the output side (0.5W), you'll need 0.5W * 2.5 / 9V = ~150mA from the input end. The quiescent current is about 70mA at all time, even when the other coil is not anywhere near by.

These are basic modules, probably used for some low cost toy. We don't have any datasheets or specifications for them. We do see a feedback resistor divider on the output side using 0603 SMT resistors so an advanced user could solder in different values to turn it into a different valued output.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1459-02.jpg,1459.jpg,$9.95

If you're really like me, you've wanted the sensor to come with a low current draw and on a tiny carrier board with all of the external components required to make it work.The Pololu Carrier with Sharp GP2Y0D810Z0F Digital Distance Sensor fits those both needs and more. it's one of Sharp's fastest distance sensors - with a sample rate of almost 400 Hz and is an attractive alternative to short range phototransistors and longer range analog distance sensors.Output is high normally and low when the sensor detects an object. This sensor only tells if the object's nearby - not how near or far the sensor is - so they're great for break-beam, obstacle detection, and object counting.This sensor comes with a 3-pin male header and a 3-pin right-angle male header. You can connect these pins with a servo cable. The square pad is ground, middle is VIN, and the remaining pad is output. If you place a large capacitor (more than 10uF) between power and ground you should see an increase in performance.We carry a large variety of Sharp Distance sensors here if this fellow isn't what you're looking for.",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/1927-02.jpg,1927.jpg,$7.95

Inside, it's an Angstrom linux box running Webkit that features chroma-key video compositing. Out of the box, the reference firmware enables the overlay of Facebook and Twitter feeds, and SMSes from Android phones. The UI is written in Javascript/HTML, making it easy and fast to develop your custom application.The system also features a convenient HTTP API which uses POST commands to issue events to the screen and control device behavior. This, combined with zeroconf discoverability via Bonjour, makes integrating NeTV with other networked devices (such as your smartphone or laptop) a snap.FPGA geeks take note! NeTV does video compositing with an FPGA. The FPGA is managed using a convenient set of built-in command-line tools. You can modify the NeTV's video processing capability using Xilinx's free Webkit development environment.

http://adafruit.com/product/2949,Adafruit Mini Skinny NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - 30 LED/m - WHITE,"There are 30 RGB LEDs per meter, and you can control each LED individually! Yes, that's right, this is the digitally-addressable type of LED strip. You can set the color of each LED's red, green and blue component with 8-bit PWM precision (so 24-bit color per pixel). The LEDs are controlled by shift-registers that are chained up down the strip so you can shorten or lengthen the strip. Only 1 digital output pin are required to send data down. The PWM is built into each LED-chip so once you set the color you can stop talking to the strip and it will continue to PWM all the LEDs for youThe strip is made of flexible PCB material, and comes with a weatherproof sheathing. You can cut this stuff pretty easily with wire cutters, there are cut-lines every 1.27""/32.5mm (1 LED each). Solder to the 0.1"" copper pads and you're good to go. Of course, you can also connect strips together to make them longer, just watch how much current you need!Â We have a 5V/2A supply that should be able to drive 1 meterÂ andÂ a 5V/10A supply that can drive up to 10 metersÂ (depending on use)Â You must use a 5V DC power supply to power these strips, do not use higher than 6V or you can destroy the entire stripThese come in 5 meter reelsÂ with aÂ 2 or 3-pin JST SM connectorÂ on each end and separated power/ground wires. These strips areÂ sold by the meter! If you buy 5 meters at a time, you'll get full reels with two connectors. If you buy less than 5m, you'll get a single strip, but it will be a cut piece from a reel which may or may not have a connector on it.To wire up these strips we suggest picking up aÂ 2.1mm DC jack to wire in so you can connect one of our wall adapters to power it. For the data + ground pins,Â you can pick up 2-pin JST setÂ to turn it into a quick connection.Our detailed NeoPixel Uberguide has everything you need to use NeoPixels in any shape and size.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/416,White Electroluminescent (EL) Tape Strip -100cm w/two connectors,"EL tape is the big sister to EL wire - it has the same glow effect but with a flat, wide shape instead of a round shape. The glowing part of the tape is 1 cm wide (the plastic coating is about 1.5cm wide). The other side has an adhesive on it so you can stick the tape onto something. Its covered in what seems to be PVC, the tape is thus weather-proof - but note that the connectors are NOT waterproof, just a bit of heatshrink. This isn't something we would suggest leaving outdoors for extended periods.

Because EL tape has more surface area than wire, it requires a more powerful inverter for the same length. This tape is about 4 times more capacitive (per length) than our high-brightness EL wire and 8 times more capacitive than 'standard' EL wire. For that reason, we are shipping the EL tape in 100cm lengths with two EL connectors soldered on, one on each end. You can cut it into two pieces of any length and use both halves!

Note that the maximum amount for the 2xAA pocket inverter we carry is 60cm so don't try to run the full strip off of one inverter - it will look dim and isnt nice to the inverter - cut it in half first! Plug it in and it will light up nicely! A 50cm strip draws about 200mA from the 2xAA batteries in the pocket inverter (so 2000mAh batteries will last ~10 hours if on 'constant' mode). You can also use our 4xAAA inverter which is strong enough to power a full meter at once - plug in only one end of the tape to the inverter or cut it in half and plug both halves in.

Please note! EL tape, EL wire and EL panel are made with different processes and so the color and brightness will not be consistant between the two: white tape, white wire and white panels will not necessarily match!

As long as youÂ aren'tÂ lighting up all the pixels full power white that should be fine. If you want to power the shield with an external power supply, solder in the included terminal block (pro-tip: put it on the bottom of the board so it doesn't stick up) to wire in an external 4-6VDC power supply - that power supply will also power the Arduino and shield. If you want to use the terminal block to power the shield but keep the Arduino itself on DC or USB power only, cut the center of the solder jumper to the right of the terminal block. There's a polarity protection FET on the external input in case you wire the power backwards (we would never do that, it was, umm, a friend of ours, yeah that's it!)If, say, you need MORE blinky, you can chain these together. For the second shield, connect the DIN connection to the first shield's DOUT. Also connect a ground pin together and power with 5V. There you go! You can chain as many as you'd like although after 5 or more shields you may run low on RAM if you're using an UNO.We include both stacking headers and plain headers.

While it is designed to be submersible in water, it's always best to avoid long-term submersion (over 1 hour at a time), and it obviously would only give you temperature readings.

However, neither of these are happy to work with I2C, which uses a funky pull-up system to transfer data back and forth. This level shifter board combines the ease-of-use of the bi-directional TXB0108 with an I2C-compatible FET design following NXP's app note.This breakout has 4 BSS138 FETs with 10K pullups. It works down to 1.8V on the low side, and up to 10V on the high side. The 10K's do make the interface a little more sluggish than using a TXB0108 or 74LVC245 so we suggest checking those out if you need high-speed transfer.While we designed it for use with I2C, this works as well forÂ  TTL Serial,Â  slow <2MHz SPI, and any other digital interface both uni-directional and bidirectional.

https://www.adafruit.com/product/2432,Adafruit DotStar LED Strip - Addressable Cool White - 30 LED/m - ~6000K,"However, unlike NeoPixels, these LEDs have 2 wires (input and output) for sending data - one clock pin and one data pin. That means you need two pins, not one, to control DotStars.Â Because the clock and data is separated, you can use any processor speed or type to control these strips, and you don't have to worry about being careful with the timing. Hardware SPI support is handy but not required. This makes them excellent for use with any microcontroller or microprocessor, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Propeller, SparkCore, and any 'raw' microcontrollers/microprocessors. It's very easy to port the library, and you can send data to the pixels at up to 32MHz clock rate!",https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-videos/1024x768/2432-03.jpg,2432.jpg,$99.75
